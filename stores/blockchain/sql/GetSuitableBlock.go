// Package sql implements the blockchain.Store interface using SQL database backends.
// It provides concrete SQL-based implementations for all blockchain operations
// defined in the interface, with support for different SQL engines.
//
// This file implements the GetSuitableBlock method, which retrieves information needed
// for mining new blocks. In Bitcoin-based blockchains like BSV, mining requires knowledge
// of the current blockchain state, including difficulty targets and timestamps from recent
// blocks. The implementation uses a recursive Common Table Expression (CTE) in SQL to
// efficiently retrieve a sequence of blocks from the current tip backward, then calculates
// the median time and appropriate difficulty target based on Bitcoin consensus rules.
// This functionality is essential for Teranode's mining support and integration with
// mining pools.

// GetSuitableBlock retrieves information needed for mining a new block.
// This implements the blockchain.Store.GetSuitableBlock interface method.
//
// The method retrieves data necessary for mining operations, including the appropriate
// difficulty target (nBits) and median time of recent blocks. In Bitcoin-based blockchains,
// mining requires adherence to consensus rules regarding difficulty adjustments and
// timestamp validation, which depend on the state of recent blocks in the chain.
//
// The implementation uses a recursive SQL query to efficiently retrieve a sequence of blocks
// from the specified starting block backward. It then processes these blocks to calculate
// the median time (used for timestamp validation) and determine the appropriate difficulty
// target based on Bitcoin consensus rules. This information is essential for miners to
// construct valid block headers and perform proof-of-work calculations.
//
// Parameters:
//   - ctx: Context for the database operation, allowing for cancellation and timeouts
//   - hash: The hash of the current tip block from which to calculate mining parameters
//
// Returns:
//   - *model.SuitableBlock: A structure containing the necessary information for mining,
//     including block height, previous block hash, difficulty target, and median time
//   - error: Any error encountered during retrieval or calculation, specifically:
//   - BlockNotFoundError if the specified block doesn't exist
//   - StorageError for database errors or processing failures
