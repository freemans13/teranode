// Package sql implements the blockchain.Store interface using SQL database backends.
// It provides concrete SQL-based implementations for all blockchain operations
// defined in the interface, with support for different SQL engines.
//
// This file implements the GetBlockExists method, which efficiently checks for the
// existence of a block in the blockchain by its hash. Block existence verification is
// a fundamental operation in blockchain systems, used extensively during transaction
// validation, block processing, and chain synchronization. In Teranode's high-throughput
// architecture, this operation must be extremely efficient as it may be called thousands
// of times per second during peak processing.
//
// The implementation uses a multi-tier optimization strategy:
//  1. First checks the response cache - if the block header was previously cached by
//     GetBlockHeader or GetBestBlockHeader, we know the block exists
//  2. If not found in cache, executes a minimal SQL query that only checks existence without
//     retrieving full block data
//  3. Caches the existence result (as a boolean) to optimize future queries for the same block
//
// This approach significantly reduces database load and improves response times for this
// frequently called operation. The response cache is automatically invalidated whenever blocks
// are added or the blockchain state changes, ensuring consistency with the database state.

// GetBlockExists checks if a block exists in the database by its hash.
// This implements the blockchain.Store.GetBlockExists interface method.
//
// Block existence verification is a critical and frequently performed operation in
// blockchain systems. It's used during transaction validation to verify block references,
// during block processing to check for duplicate blocks, and during chain synchronization
// to determine which blocks need to be requested from peers. In Teranode's high-throughput
// architecture, this method is optimized for maximum performance.
//
// The implementation follows a tiered approach to minimize database load:
//  1. First checks the response cache using the block hash as key
//     - If a full block header is cached (from GetBlockHeader), we immediately know it exists
//  2. If not found in cache (cache miss), executes an optimized SQL query
//     that only checks for existence without retrieving block data
//
// Note: We only leverage existing cached headers and do not cache the boolean result
// to avoid type conflicts in the shared response cache
//
// The SQL query is carefully designed to be as lightweight as possible, only checking
// for the presence of a block hash in the blocks table without retrieving any columns.
// This approach is significantly more efficient than querying for block data or even
// just the block height, especially for databases with proper indexing on the hash column.
//
// Parameters:
//   - ctx: Context for the database operation, allowing for cancellation and timeouts
//   - blockHash: The unique hash identifier of the block to check
//
// Returns:
//   - bool: True if the block exists in the database, false otherwise
//   - error: Any error encountered during the database operation, specifically:
//   - StorageError for database access errors
//   - nil if the operation was successful (even if the block doesn't exist)
