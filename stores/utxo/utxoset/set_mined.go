// stampSQL records a block against every transaction that does not already claim it, and
// clears the mempool marker when the block is on the longest chain.
//
// Every key parameter is an ARRAY, so one statement serves one transaction or a whole block.
// This used to queue one UPDATE per transaction down a single connection, which already cost
// only one round trip, so the saving is not round trips. It is PostgreSQL parsing, planning
// and executing one statement instead of thousands. The create path made the same move and
// measured 4x on the batch flush, at the same batch widths a block arrives in.
//
// A hash named twice in one call is stamped once, because an UPDATE never applies to the same
// target row twice within one statement. That matches what the per-transaction loop did, where
// the second attempt found the block already recorded and skipped it.
//
// The append is guarded rather than unconditional, so replaying a block does not record it
// twice. The guard reads the row as it stood before this statement, which is what makes a batch
// mixing already-stamped and never-stamped transactions come out right in both directions.
//
// Membership is tested on a 12-BYTE BOUNDARY. The column is a concatenation of 12-byte triples
// and the reader unpacks it that way. This used to be a plain substring search, which can match
// bytes STRADDLING two neighbouring triples, read that as already-recorded, and silently skip a
// real append, leaving a transaction that never claims a block which actually contains it.
// unstampSQL carries the identical test, and it matters more there.
//
// The marker is cleared only when the caller states the block is on the longest chain. That
// is the same rule the create gate applies, and for the same reason: "mined into some block"
// and "on the main chain" are different facts, and a transaction whose only block later
// loses must stay in the mempool set.
//
// THE LEAF IS A SCALAR AND THE TXIDS AN ARRAY, so the statement runs once per leaf group. See
// leafGroups for the measurements: it is the only one of the three key shapes whose cost is a
// function of the batch rather than of the mempool.

//
// The entry to remove is located on a 12-BYTE BOUNDARY, and that is the worse half of the
// alignment rule rather than a symmetry. This used to splice 12 bytes out from wherever a plain
// substring search first matched. At an unaligned offset that destroys the tail of one triple
// and the head of the next, and the result is still a multiple of 12, so the length constraint
// does not catch it and the reader cannot tell it has been handed two invented blocks. A value
// that is not present on a boundary is not an entry at all, so the right answer is to change
// nothing, which is what the coalesce does when no aligned match exists.
//
// The clock is the store's current tip, NOT the transaction's creation height, and that is
// the fact that decides whether these two columns are one concept or two. A transaction
// created at height 100 and un-mined while the tip is 5,000 must wait from 5,000, or the

// un-mine or a further stamp to reduce it to one.
//
// A row carrying conflicting children used to be left behind too, because the bookkeeping was
// a column of tx_ident and tx_mined had nowhere to put it -- so a contested transaction was
// pinned in the mempool table for good. That bookkeeping is a side table now, keyed on the
// txid in either table, so a contested parent moves like any other.
//
// The single-block test is an EQUALITY against the packed triple this stamp just appended, not
// a length test, and that does both halves of the job at once: it is true only when the
// membership column holds twelve bytes AND those twelve bytes are THIS block. A row whose one
// triple named some other block would otherwise move under this block's facts. The length test
// alone cannot go wrong today, because stampSQL has already appended this block by the time
// this statement runs, but the equality does not depend on that ordering holding.
//
// mined_height, block_id and subtree_idx come from the parameters rather than from decoding the
// membership bytes, because the equality above has already proved the two agree.
//
// THE LEAF IS A SCALAR AND THE TXIDS AN ARRAY, so this runs once per leaf group, and that is
// the difference between one index descent per key and a read of the whole mempool. See
// leafGroups for the three key shapes measured and the numbers. The LATERAL fence the read
// statements use is not available here: a DELETE cannot laterally reference its own target.
//
// txid = ANY is EXACT despite dropping the pairing. txid is the full 32 bytes and tx_ident_ck
// makes leaf a function of it, so no row can satisfy the txid qual under a leaf other than its
// own. The leaf is therefore redundant as a filter and load-bearing as an access path: it is
// what prunes to the one partition and what makes the primary key usable, since txid is its
// second column.
//
// It RETURNS the txids it moved, and that is what keeps the postcondition cheap. provePresentSQL
// reads tx_ident only, so without this every row the move just settled would be reported absent
// and fall into the residue set -- an appendMinedSQL and a minedIDsByTxid at full block width on
// every longest-chain stamp, which is the ordinary tip path. The ids returned are the ones that
// LEFT tx_ident, taken from the DELETE's own RETURNING rather than the INSERT's: an insert that
// hits the membership key (the same block replayed) reports nothing, yet the identity row is
// gone all the same, so keying off the insert would leak those rows back into the residue.

// moveBackSQL is the un-mine: it takes a transaction out of the membership table and puts it
// back in the mempool table, with the unconfirmed marker at the CURRENT tip and the blocks it
// still remembers packed as fork triples. It is the exact reverse of moveToMinedSQL, and the
// reverse of moveToMinedSQL is what makes the two tables one store rather than two.
//
// A transaction lives in EXACTLY ONE of the two tables at any time, so `gone` deletes EVERY
// membership row of the txid and not just the un-mined block's. That is an invariant with
// teeth rather than symmetry: the lazy coin stamp at window retirement reads membership rows,
// so a row left behind here would later stamp this transaction's coins into a block it no
// longer settles under, and the read path's identity-then-membership order assumes one home.
// Deleting only the named block's row and re-packing the others as fork triples would leave
// the transaction in both tables at once, claiming the same block twice in two different
// spellings.
//
// Only a transaction that HAS a membership row for the named block takes part, which `named`
// establishes before anything is deleted. A transaction the caller un-mines from a block it was
// never in has nothing to take back, and taking it back anyway would un-settle it out of the
// block it actually IS in -- turning a tolerated absence into a wrong answer. When no block is
// named ($2 NULL) `named` is empty and irrelevant, and every row of every listed transaction
// goes.
//
// There is NO `ON CONFLICT` on the identity insert, deliberately, and the absence is the safety
// property. `gone` has already deleted the membership rows by the time the insert runs, so a
// conflict swallowed here would lose the transaction's block facts from BOTH tables at once. A
// unique violation instead rolls the whole move back, having lost nothing. The conflict means a
// transaction had a home in both tables, which createIdentPlanSQL's membership guard is what
// prevents; if it ever happens, the loud failure is the bug report.
//
// ONE STATEMENT SERVES BOTH DIRECTIONS, and the difference between them is a single predicate
// on `packed`: which triples survive into membership.
//
//   - SetMinedMulti's un-mine NAMES a block, so that block's triple is DROPPED and the others
//     are kept. NULL membership when the named block was the only one, which is what a
//     transaction no block has ever named already carries, so the two spellings of "no block"
//     stay one.
//   - MarkTransactionsOnLongestChain(false) names none -- it says only that the chain the node
//     now believes in does not contain this transaction -- so it cannot drop any single block
//     and ALL of them are kept for a later stamp or un-mine to resolve. $2 and $3 arrive NULL.
//
// The join to `packed` is LEFT for that first case: an un-mine of the only block leaves no
// triples at all, and an inner join would then drop the identity row the un-mine exists to
// write.
//
// The membership is packed from `gone` itself, never from a second read of tx_mined, and that
// closes a PostgreSQL trap as well as being simpler: a data-modifying CTE's effects are NOT
// visible to its sibling CTEs, which all see the snapshot the statement began with, so a
// sibling that re-read tx_mined would still see the rows `gone` is deleting and hand back the
// very block it was told to forget.
//
// The keys reach the DELETE as `txid = ANY(...)`, not as a join against unnest, and the reason
// is the one moveToMinedSQL gives: tx_mined's primary key LEADS with txid, so the array form is
// one index descent per key per live window, while the join form lets the planner hash the keys
// against a window and read it whole -- measured on this schema at 500 keys against a 60,000-row
// window, a Seq Scan and 7 ms of the statement's 13.
//
// The clock is $4, the store's CURRENT height, not the transaction's created_height. See
// unstampSQL: a transaction created at 100 and un-mined at a tip of 5,000 must wait from
// 5,000, or the preservation pass fires on it immediately.
//
// The fee comes back with the row. tx_mined carries it precisely so that this move can return
// it, because the transaction is handed to block assembly, which prices it.
//
// The COINS are reset by a separate statement in the same transaction, resetCoinsSQL, and not
// by a further CTE here. A CTE cannot take the packed-key range as a plain array value -- it
// would have to compute the bounds from the deleted rows -- and the planner then costs the
// range as a join filter and reads all eight coin partitions instead: measured on this schema
// at 400,000 coins, a Seq Scan on every partition and 98 ms of the statement's 108.
