// claimBlockSQL takes the ledger row for a block, or reports that someone already has it.
//
// ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING is genuinely idempotent here, unlike on the UTXO table: this
// table has a real PRIMARY KEY for it to act on. It is also the concurrency gate. A
// second caller offering the same block blocks on the conflicting row until the first
// transaction resolves, then inserts nothing if that transaction committed, or takes the
// claim if it rolled back. So a caller can never skip a block whose application is still
// in flight, and a rolled-back application never leaves the block marked as done.

// ApplyBlock runs fn as one atomic, replay-safe unit of block application.
//
// It returns (true, nil) when fn ran and committed, and (false, nil) when the block had
// already been applied and was therefore skipped.
//
// This gate is not an optimisation, it is what keeps the store from inflating the money
// supply. The UTXO table's ukey is a 96-bit prefix and deliberately NON-UNIQUE, so
// createSQL has no ON CONFLICT that could make an insert idempotent, and re-applying a
// block would insert every output a second time as independently spendable rows. Replay
// is routine rather than exotic: catchup, a restart mid-window, and the documented
// post-restart unrequested-block storm all re-offer blocks. The ledger is therefore
// ground truth written in the SAME transaction as the work it describes, so the claim
// and the rows it authorises commit or roll back together.
//
// Running fn inside that one transaction is the second half of the guard, and it is what
// makes the coinbase safe. A replayed ordinary transaction would fail its spends anyway,
// because the parents it consumes are gone, and take the chunk down with it. A coinbase
// has no inputs and so has no failing spend to trigger that rollback; only the ledger
// stops it.

//   - Completed, so skip. Re-applying would insert every output a second time as an
//     independently spendable row, because createSQL has no ON CONFLICT to protect it.
//     That is money-supply inflation.
//   - Claimed but never completed, so RE-APPLY. The previous attempt died part-way. If we
//     skipped it, its outputs would never exist, every later block spending them would
//     fail forever, and nothing downstream would flag it. Silent loss is worse than the
//     duplication it avoids.
//
// Re-applying an incomplete block can still duplicate whatever the dead attempt managed
// to write. This does not fix that, and does not claim to: making it safe needs create
// and spend for a chunk in one transaction with applied_chunk tracking which rows landed.
// What this closes is replay of a FINISHED block, which is the routine case (catchup, a
// restart, the post-restart unrequested-block storm).
