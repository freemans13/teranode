// TestAutovacuumThresholdIsSizedToTheIndex pins a number that silently caps throughput.
//
// A delete-on-spend store creates roughly 33,000 dead tuples per block, forever, so
// autovacuum is the one background job it does have, and unlike the pruner it CAN fall
// behind. Each pass is a full scan of that partition's index.
//
// The shipped value was 200,000, which is ten times more aggressive than the figure the
// design was costed against (utxo-set-store-design.md:459 uses 2,000,000). At fat-band
// density 200,000 triggers a full index scan every 19 blocks per partition, about 1.13 GB
// per block of index scanning, which caps the node near 2.65 blocks per second on that
// term alone. 1,000,000 gives roughly 0.23 GB per block, at a cost of about 1.6 GB of
// resident dead rows.
//
// scale_factor stays 0 deliberately: scale-factor triggering is proportional to table
// size, and the dead-row rate here is proportional to block production instead.
