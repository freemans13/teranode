// The suite used to be opt-in behind UTXOSET_CONFORMANCE, because it failed while the store
// was incomplete and a permanently red package makes a real regression indistinguishable from
// the known gap. It passes now, so the gate is gone: it runs with everything else, and a
// failure means a regression rather than a to-do list.

// The store-agnostic conformance suite is this store's specification. Every other
// implementation (postgres, aerospike, sql) is held to it, and the same invariants must
// hold here regardless of how radically the storage model differs underneath.
//
// Each subtest is named for the capability it pins, so a failure says what is missing rather
// than merely that something is. They all pass; a suite not listed here is one this store does
// not implement the entry point for, not one that is failing quietly.
