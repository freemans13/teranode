// spendingDataSQL reports, for one transaction, which of its outputs still exist and which were
// taken and by whom.
//
// Both halves are needed, and neither alone would do. A live coin proves an output exists and
// is unspent. A journal row proves one existed and names the transaction that destroyed it. An
// output that appears in neither is one this store cannot speak for: either it never existed,
// because a provably unspendable output never gets a row, or its spend is older than the
// journal's retention.
//
// Located by a key RANGE and authorised by the full 32-byte transaction id. The packed key
// leads with the id prefix so that "every output of this transaction" is an index range scan,
// but that prefix is 96 bits and non-unique by design. Without the recheck a prefix collision
// would name a stranger as the spender of this transaction's coin, and the conflict walk would
// then mark that stranger conflicting along with everything descended from it.

// It is the one field this store does not answer for free. Everything else on a metadata read
// arrives on a single row from a single statement, so narrowing the projection would save
// nothing, but naming the spender of every output costs a second query across two tables. The
// validator resolves parents constantly and never needs it, so it stays off that path unless

// decorateSpendingData fills in who took each of a transaction's outputs.
//
// The shared conflict walks ask this question of every parent they reach and act on the answer,
// and they ask it through the metadata read rather than through any store method. This store
// deletes the coin row on spend, so the answer is not in the coin table: it is in the journal,
// which recorded the spender at the moment of the delete. Until this existed the walks saw an
// empty answer for every parent, failed on the first input, and conflict handling could not run
// here at all.
//
// The slice is indexed by output number and sized to the highest output the store knows about.
// An input naming an output beyond that is one this store genuinely cannot speak for, and the
// caller's own range check reports it rather than this silently reporting the output as
// unspent, which is the answer that would let a double spend through.
//
// The input index on each entry is left at zero. The journal does not record which input of the
// spending transaction consumed the coin, and nothing that reads this field uses it: the two
// places that read an input index take it from the single-outpoint spend lookup instead. It is
// stated here so a later reader does not mistake the zero for a fact.
//
// Bounded by the journal's retention, like every other spender-identity answer in this store.
// Beyond it a spent output looks the same as one that never existed.
