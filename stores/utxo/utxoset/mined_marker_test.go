// TestCreateWithABlockIsNotAlsoWaitingToBeMined.
//
// A transaction cannot be mined and waiting to be mined at the same time. It is created
// BECAUSE a block contains it, so the block information being present is what settles the
// question, and the store must not also mark it as sitting in the mempool.
//
// This store used to require the block information to additionally claim the block was on the
// longest chain. The block-application path never says that, because at create time the block
// is still being validated, so every transaction created by a sync was stored in both states at
// once. On the mainnet box that reached 3.8 million rows, which is 91% of the store, and it
// stalled the reclaim: the pass that walks transactions waiting to be mined had millions to
// walk, and it runs before the reclaim, so nothing was ever reclaimed.
//
// The sql store keys on whether any block information was supplied at all, and this now matches
// it.
