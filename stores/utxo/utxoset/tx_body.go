// twelve lines away in spend_journal.go for the journal's own partitions:
//
//   - ATTACHED. The normal case.
//   - ORPHANED. A crash between DETACH and DROP leaves a fully standalone table: relispartition
//     goes FALSE and the pg_inherits row is GONE. An inner join can never see it again, so its
//     disk is never returned and nothing reports it. Found here by name within tx_body's own
//     schema, which is all that still identifies it.
//   - DETACH PENDING. A crash DURING a concurrent detach leaves inhdetachpending set. PostgreSQL
//     then refuses every further ATTACH and DETACH on the parent, so the detach below fails on
//     every call, dropTxBodyWindowsBelow returns an error, and Prune returns before it reaches
//     the journal loop at all. That is the WHOLE cleanup stopped, not one table leaked, and it
//     would also fail the CREATE TABLE ... PARTITION OF that the create path runs at each
//     48-block rollover.
//
// Resolved through regclass so it finds windows of the SAME table the DROP below will name.
// Matching on a bare name would search every schema in the database, and an unqualified drop
// would then resolve against the search path and fail, aborting the loop before a single real
// window went.
