// stampRetiringWindowChunk is the page size for reading a retiring window's rows. 20,000 keeps
// one round trip's argument arrays and the chunk's own working set modest, while still being

// bounded number of round trips rather than one per transaction.
const stampRetiringWindowChunk = 20_000

// retiringWindowRowsSQL lists a window's rows in (txid, seq) order, to name WHICH transactions
// the coin stamp has to visit. It deliberately does not read mined_height or block_id: this
// window's own row is not necessarily the transaction's earliest, so the block facts come from
// firstMinedRowSQL instead.
//
// Paged by a KEYSET on (txid, seq) rather than OFFSET, so the plan stays an index scan at every
// page rather than degrading as the offset grows: an OFFSET-based page has to skip every row
// before it, which is O(rows read so far) per page over a window that can hold tens of millions
// of rows. Ordering by txid also keeps one transaction's rows contiguous across page
// boundaries, which is what makes the dedup below correct.
const retiringWindowRowsSQL = `

 LIMIT $3`

// firstMinedRowSQL resolves, for each listed transaction, the block named by its EARLIEST
// membership row across EVERY LIVE WINDOW -- not just the one that is retiring.
//
// It has to look across windows because a transaction's rows do not all live in one. A window
// is keyed by mined_height, and a transaction mined at height h can be fork-stamped at h-1 or
// h+1 by appendMinedSQL, which straddles a 288 boundary about one block in 288. The older
// window then retires first, and stamping from the row IT holds would hand the coin a FORK
// block whenever that is the row it has -- permanently, because the mined_height = 0 guard
// skips the coin when the other window retires and nothing survives to correct it from.
//
// The earliest row by seq is the transaction's LONGEST-CHAIN stamp, and that is a rule rather
// than an ordering accident. Since task 9 a transaction only reaches the membership table by a
// longest-chain stamp or a block-path create; a fork stamp gets there only by appendMinedSQL,
// which copies an EXISTING row's payload, so it can never be the first row. seq is a table-wide
// identity, so "earliest" is well defined across windows without comparing heights -- which
// would be the wrong test anyway, as this statement's own fork case shows.
//
// The keys sit on the OUTSIDE of a LATERAL with an OFFSET 0 fence, the shape minedByTxidSQL and
// appendMinedSQL use: one primary-key descent per key per live window. A plain
// `JOIN tx_mined m ON m.txid = ANY(...)` lets the planner hash the keys against the windows and
// read them whole, which is what the measurements behind minedByTxidSQL found at 500 keys.
const firstMinedRowSQL = `
SELECT k.txid, m.mined_height, m.block_id
  FROM unnest($1::bytea[]) AS k(txid)
 CROSS JOIN LATERAL (
   SELECT m.mined_height, m.block_id
     FROM tx_mined m
    WHERE m.txid = k.txid
    ORDER BY m.seq
    LIMIT 1 OFFSET 0
 ) AS m`

// stampCoinsSQL stamps every live (unconfirmed) coin of the listed transactions with the
// block their FIRST surviving tx_mined row named. See liveCoinArgs for the leaf/lo/hi shape;
// $5 and $6 are the parallel height and block-id arrays keyed to the same transaction.
//
// mined_height = 0 is what makes this idempotent and leaves a block-path coin -- stamped with
// its facts at create, never at the sentinel -- untouched. A coin that has already been
// stamped this way, or created directly by the block path, must not be touched a second time:
// nothing here can tell "already correct" from "a later, wrong window" apart except that guard.
//
// The fenced read runs FIRST, in a CTE, and the UPDATE then matches on the exact (leaf, ukey)
// it returns -- the same shape resetCoinsSQL uses, and for the identical reason. A plain
// `UPDATE ... FROM unnest(...) AS k WHERE u.leaf = k.leaf AND u.ukey >= k.lo AND ...` was
// measured first, on 40,000 seeded coins across all eight leaves with 500 keys: a Hash Join
// against a Seq Scan of every one of the eight coin partitions, because the planner can build
// a hash on (leaf, txid) from the whole table more cheaply than it can cost 500 per-key index
// probes, and the ukey range only applies as a post-join filter rather than an index
// condition. The CROSS JOIN LATERAL with an OFFSET 0 fence is what forces an index scan per
// key instead: an UPDATE cannot laterally reference its own target, so the read has to happen
// in a CTE the UPDATE then joins on the row identity it found, not on the search predicate.
//
// EVERY live coin of the transaction is stamped, not just one, so the LATERAL carries no
// LIMIT -- unlike coinFactsSQL, which only ever needs one.
//
// The UPDATE rechecks the FULL TXID and not only the (leaf, ukey) the read found the row by.
// ukey is a 96-bit prefix and NON-UNIQUE by design -- see Pack -- so a stranger's coin in the
// same leaf can share it, and it is a coin at the SENTINEL that this statement is looking for,
// which is exactly what a colliding row is most likely to be. Stamping it would hand a coin the
// facts of a block that does not contain its transaction, and once this window is dropped there
// is nothing left to correct it from. resetCoinsSQL carries the identical recheck.
