// Package utxoset is a delete-on-spend UTXO-set store.
//
// It inverts what the postgres store indexes. That store records a spend as the
// PRESENCE of a row in an append-only `spends` table and detects a double-spend as a
// unique-constraint violation, which means the indexed structure is the set of
// everything ever spent — measured at 392,884,647 rows and growing with every block.
// This store indexes only the live UNSPENT set — measured at 74,426,411 and roughly
// flat — and detects a double-spend by ABSENCE. A spend becomes a DELETE.
//
// That single DELETE does four jobs at once: it arbitrates the double-spend (zero rows
// affected means the outpoint is already gone), it is the decorate fetch (RETURNING
// hands back satoshis and locking script, so PreviousOutputsDecorate never parses a
// raw transaction), it is the reclaim (no sweep, no pruner, no pending_deletes), and it
// is the write. The DAH sweep, pruner, spent_bits fold, reconciler and stagnation
// monitor do not exist here — on the mainnet box those measured at 76.7% of all disk
// reads, 52% of statement WAL and 25-30% of CPU.
//
// "No background job that can fall behind" is NOT true, and the qualifier matters.
// Autovacuum is that job: this store makes roughly 33,000 dead tuples per block forever,
// each pass is a full scan of a partition index, and it is unmeasured at scale. What
// delete-on-spend removes is the RECLAIM backlog, whose watermark on the old store sat
// 5,567 to 6,227 blocks behind the tip. It does not remove vacuum, and the autovacuum
// threshold below is sized deliberately for that reason.
//
// Measured evidence behind the design (see docs/superpowers/specs/):
//   - index bloat plateaus at exactly 2.00x its bulk-build floor and fully reverses via
//     REINDEX CONCURRENTLY (3.1 s per 10M entries)
//   - a packed 16-byte key costs 63.07 B per index entry at churn equilibrium, against
//     81.3 B for a bytea32 key
//
// Two claims that used to sit here have been REMOVED rather than softened, because
// neither has a source anywhere in this repository:
//
//   - "UTXO index 8.4 GB at the projected tip, vs a 25 GB budget". That figure is the
//     post-REINDEX floor at an assumed UTXO count, not a steady state, and the count it
//     assumed is the least certain input in the whole design. The honest position is that
//     nobody has run gettxoutsetinfo on a synced SV Node, so the tip index size is unknown.
//   - "19x less WAL per spend and 23x fewer full-page images than append-only".
//     Reconstructed from the underlying figures the best case is nearer 11.5x and 12.5x,
//     and the ratio INVERTS at high UTXO counts, because delete-on-spend does not avoid
//     the index write, it defers it to vacuum. Quote no ratio here until one is measured.
//
// M1 scope: the UTXO table, the spend journal and the block/chunk ledger. The tx_meta
// window arrives in M3.
//
// The journal is undo insurance and nothing else. It once doubled as the prune engine --
// a retiring partition was the list of parents to re-examine -- which made it load-bearing
// from genesis even below the hardcoded checkpoint, where a reorg is impossible by rule.
// It no longer is: a mined transaction claims on tx_mined, its coins carry the height and
// block that made them, and retiring its identity is dropping the window it lives in. See
// the spend_journal DDL comment below for what that leaves the journal doing.

-- it without colliding with a real block. block_id = 0 must stay legitimate rather than
-- becoming a second sentinel: the seed tool writes it (cmd/seeder/seeder.go:674-681) and

-- THE LEDGER. Replay safety.
--
-- The UTXO table's key is non-unique, so there is no ON CONFLICT (txid, vout) to make
-- create idempotent. A block arriving twice, arriving out of order, or being
-- re-applied after a crash must therefore be rejected by ground truth: a durable
-- record written in the SAME transaction as the work it describes. This is what
-- keeps invariant 5 intact — nothing is authorised by a counter.
-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- THE SPEND JOURNAL. svnode's rev*.dat, in a table.
--
-- A delete-on-spend store destroys the row, so a reorg or a conflict resolution has
-- nothing to restore FROM unless the payload is captured at the moment it is deleted.
-- Re-deriving it from the block is not an option: this node retains 696 KB of blocks
-- against 2,838 GB of chain, and the subtree data it does keep is not in extended
-- format, so it records WHICH outpoints a block consumed and none of their satoshis or
-- scripts.
--
-- The journal row is therefore written in the SAME STATEMENT as the delete, not merely
-- the same transaction -- see spendJournalSQL. It carries every field needed to
-- reconstruct the UTXO row byte-for-byte, including hash_override, because
-- ReAssignUTXO splices an operator-supplied utxo hash that is NOT derivable from
-- (txid, vout, satoshis, script); recomputing it on restore would silently reverse a
-- court-ordered reassignment.
--
-- spending_txid is an ownership token, deliberately NOT indexed: a restore must match
-- the spender that actually took the coin, so a stale reorg record whose output has
-- since been re-spent by a different transaction matches nothing and is a no-op rather
-- than resurrecting a coin someone else now owns.
--
-- RANGE partitioned by spent_height so retiring it is DROP TABLE -- O(1), no scan, no
-- vacuum, no background job that can fall behind. Age clusters by insert time by
-- definition, which is why partition-drop works here and did not for the rejected
-- epoch-slab design (there, garbage clustered by SPEND time, which is decorrelated
-- from creation).
--
-- IT IS UNDO INSURANCE, AND ONLY THAT.
--
-- It used to be the PRUNE ENGINE as well, and that is why it had no off-switch. A spend
-- deletes one coin row and signals nothing, so "that transaction's last output has now
-- gone" was a fact about absence recorded nowhere else, and the journal recorded it for
-- free: every spend writes a row, rows are grouped by height, and a retiring partition
-- therefore WAS the list of transactions to re-examine. Retiring an identity needed that
-- list, so the journal was load-bearing even below the hardcoded checkpoint where a reorg
-- is impossible by rule.
--
-- It is not any more. A mined transaction claims on tx_mined, in 288-block windows, and its
-- coins carry the height and block of the transaction that made them, so retiring its
-- identity is dropping a window and nothing has to be re-examined at all. What is left here
-- is a restore, by outpoint, of a spend inside the retention window. Measured cost of
-- keeping it: 354.8 bytes of WAL and 12.9 microseconds per spend, about 6% of the per-block
-- budget in the worst band. Cheap enough that it stays on below the checkpoint too, rather
-- than adding a second write path that only the tip exercises.

-- CONFLICT BOOKKEEPING. One row per (contested parent, losing child).
--
-- A transaction that loses a double-spend race is kept rather than discarded, because
-- resolving the race later has to find it, and finding it means asking the PARENT whose coin
-- was contested. This table IS that route.
--
-- It is a side table rather than a column on tx_ident, and that is a correctness requirement
-- rather than normalisation for its own sake. A contested parent is very often MINED, and a
-- mined transaction has no identity row at all: the longest-chain stamp moved it into
-- tx_mined. A column on tx_ident therefore had nowhere to land the note, so the write was a
-- zero-row update and the route silently did not exist -- and the stamp had to REFUSE to move
-- any row carrying the column, pinning contested transactions in the mempool table forever.
-- Keyed on the txid alone, this answers for a parent in either table, or in neither.
--
-- RANGE partitioned on noted_height, in the SAME 48-block windows as the spend journal and
-- created by the same DDL statement, so a window exists whenever its journal leaf does. It is
-- dropped in the same pass and on the same cutoff, which is the honest retention: the journal
-- is what conflict resolution restores the losing spends FROM, so a note whose journal leaf
-- has gone can no longer be acted on.
--
-- noted_height is the store's CURRENT chain height at the moment of noting, not a property of
-- either transaction. It is bookkeeping about a race happening now.
--
-- The uniqueness is PER WINDOW, deliberately, and the reader deduplicates. A unique index on
-- a partitioned table must include the partition key, so a global UNIQUE (parent_txid,
-- child_txid) is not available without noted_height in it -- which would defeat the purpose,
-- since the same pair noted at two heights would then be two legal rows anyway. So each
-- window carries a plain UNIQUE (parent_txid, child_txid), the inserts are ON CONFLICT DO
-- NOTHING against it, and the read is SELECT DISTINCT: a repeated note inside one window
-- writes nothing, and the same pair noted in two windows reads back once.
--
-- That pair index is the window's ONLY index, and it serves the reads too, because
-- parent_txid leads it and every read here is by parent_txid. See ensureSpendJournalPartition
-- for the DDL and the measurement.

-- BLOCK MEMBERSHIP. One row per (transaction, block) that stamped it, for the reorg window.
--
-- This replaces the identity row for a MINED transaction. Below the checkpoint it is written

-- here when its block is stamped on the longest chain (stage 2). It is RANGE partitioned by
-- mined_height in 288-block windows and dropped whole once a window's upper bound is 1440
-- blocks below the pruner's height, so reclaim is a catalog operation with nothing to fall
-- behind on.
--
-- The primary key LEADS with txid. PostgreSQL requires the partition key inside a partitioned
-- table's primary key but not at its head, and a height-leading key cannot be probed by
-- transaction id: on 18 it becomes a skip scan over every distinct height in the partition.
-- Every by-id lookup here is one descent per live window, six at 288-block windows.
--
-- seq keeps insertion order, which the shared conformance suite requires of BlockIDs.
-- The payload columns are what a transaction needs if it is un-mined back into the mempool
-- (stage 2); below the checkpoint tx_inpoints is written NULL because nothing there can
-- un-mine.
--
-- fee is carried because tx_ident carries one and the tip's stamp MOVES that row here. A
-- transaction un-mined back into the mempool is handed to block assembly, which prices it,
-- so dropping the column would silently zero the fee of every reorged transaction. It is
-- nullable because the block path has no fee to carry: a create below the checkpoint writes

--
-- It exists for one case, the lingering unmined child. A parent whose window has been dropped
-- and whose coins are all spent is GONE, and that is right: nothing on the consensus path can
-- ask about a transaction that is 1440 blocks buried and has no live output. The exception is
-- an unmined child still sitting in block assembly, which will be validated again the day it
-- is finally mined and needs its parent's facts to be validated against. The pruner names
-- exactly those parents each cycle -- see PreserveParentsOfOldUnminedTransactions -- and this
-- table is where the answer for them survives.
--
-- It is TINY, and by construction rather than by hope. Nothing writes here on the block path
-- or the validator's path; the only writer is the pruner's phase 1, and it names only the
-- parents of transactions that have been waiting longer than the retention window. An
-- ordinary mempool that keeps up puts nothing in it at all.
--
-- The payload is the FULL membership payload, not just the block, because this row has to
-- answer exactly what the tx_mined row it copies would have answered: a thinner row would
-- hand block assembly a parent with no fee, no size and no inputs, which is a different
-- record rather than a slower one. See readPreserved for the read and minedRow.toMeta for
-- the conversion the two share.
--
-- This is the store-side version of what aerospike does with its preserveUntil bin: same
-- pruner, same two calls, same expiry height, but expressed as a row that outlives a dropped
-- partition instead of a bin that suppresses a delete. preserve_until is that height, and
-- ProcessExpiredPreservations deletes every row that has reached it.
--
-- NOT partitioned, deliberately. It is keyed by transaction id alone and read by primary key,
-- its rows leave by an expiry height that has nothing to do with any window's bounds, and it
-- is small enough that a delete plus autovacuum costs nothing worth a catalog operation.
--
-- The primary key is its ONLY index. Every read is by transaction id, which the key serves,
-- and the expiry sweep is a once-per-block scan of a table this small; an index on
-- preserve_until would be write amplification for a plan that has nothing to gain.

-- THE IDENTITY TABLE. One row per MEMPOOL transaction, from first sight until the block
-- that settles it.
--
-- "Settles" rather than "contains", because the two are not the same fact and the difference
-- decides whether the row leaves. A stamp naming a block ON THE LONGEST CHAIN moves the row
-- into tx_mined and deletes it here, but only when the row then names exactly ONE block. A row
-- naming two blocks stays, with its mempool marker cleared: the id-less mark-on-longest-chain
-- call cannot later say which of them is main, so the row waits for an un-mine or a further
-- stamp to reduce it to one. A stamp for a block NOT on the longest chain moves nothing at
-- all; it only appends the block.
--
-- Conflict bookkeeping used to pin a row here too, because it lived in a column of this table
-- and tx_mined had nowhere to put it. It is a side table now (see conflict_children above),
-- keyed on the txid alone, so a contested row settles like any other.
--
-- Partitioned BY LIST (leaf), the same eight-way split as utxo, and never by
-- created_height. Three reasons, worst first:
--
--   1. created_height is NOT a property of the transaction. A mempool create writes
--      tip+1, a guess; a block-application create of the SAME transaction writes the
--      block's height. One block of mempool residency makes them differ, so a key
--      including created_height admits the ordinary mempool-then-mined duplicate --
--      which is the "two outputs became four" failure this table exists to stop.
--   2. Fifteen Store methods take a txid and no height at all, and two of the
--      highest-volume ones have no height field in their argument type, so they could
--      not supply one even after an interface change.
--   3. Height only ever bought a partition drop, and a partition holds transactions whose
--      coins are still unspent, so it could never fire.
--
-- leaf is a REAL stored column. PARTITION BY LIST ((get_byte(txid,0) & 7)) is accepted
-- but then postgres bans every unique constraint on the table, and a GENERATED column
-- cannot be a partition key -- verified on 17.11 and 18.6, including 18's new VIRTUAL
-- generated columns.

-- THE BODY. Serialized transaction bytes, and nothing else.
--
-- This is the ONE part of a transaction whose life is bounded by a horizon rather
-- than by its coins. Everything on tx_ident is pinned while any output is unspent,
-- at any age, because the validator reads the parent's block ids and heights for
-- every input it spends. Keeping the bytes there too would make the transaction
-- archive permanent for that whole population: measured at 136 GB of out-of-line
-- storage today against roughly 95 GB free on the mainnet box, and past the disk
-- at the projected tip.
--
-- RANGE partitioned on created_height so reclaim is dropping a file. Measured on
-- 18.6: a partition drop returned 883 MB to the operating system for 228 KB of
-- crash-recovery journal, where the equivalent delete plus vacuum returned 128 KB
-- for 1.75 GB.
--
-- Uniqueness here is LOCAL to a partition, and that is fine rather than a
-- compromise: tx_ident already guarantees the txid appears once globally, and the
-- claim gates this insert, so two rows for one txid cannot be written.
--
-- NO DEFAULT PARTITION, ever. On 18.6 a default partition makes
-- ALTER TABLE ... DETACH PARTITION ... CONCURRENTLY impossible on every other
-- partition of the table, and the concurrent form is what keeps a drop from
-- blocking readers.

// derived here. An index only answers questions about columns on the row it indexes, and
// "is any block containing me on the main chain" is not one: the answer changes when a
// block is invalidated and no row changes. This store cannot see the chain at all -- it
// holds a pool, a pushed-in height and journal state -- so the answer has to be written
// down by the four paths that already learned it. NULL means the last thing we were told is
// that a MAIN-CHAIN block contains this transaction.
//
// The index is PARTIAL, covering only the mempool. Measured on PG 18.6 at 43,000,000 rows
// with a 43,100-transaction mempool: 524,288 bytes, which is 0.0122 bytes per table row and
// 0.016% of the primary key beside it. The reload it serves costs 3,484 page fetches with a
// fresh mempool against 978,145 for the sequential scan it would otherwise need.
//
// Do NOT add INCLUDE columns to make it index-only. Measured on 18.6: including
// tx_inpoints refuses any transaction with 82 or more inputs at INSERT time --
// "index row size 2720 exceeds btree version 4 maximum 2704" -- which is transaction
// intake down, not a slow path.
