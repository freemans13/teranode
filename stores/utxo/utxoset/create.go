// noteConflictSQL records the contesting transaction on every parent whose coin it wants.
//
// A transaction that loses a double-spend race is stored as conflicting rather than
// discarded, because resolving the conflict later has to find it. Finding it means asking the
// PARENT whose coin was contested, so the route runs from the parent, and this statement is
// what writes it. Without it, conflict resolution has no route from a contested coin to the
// transactions competing for it.
//
// It writes to conflict_children rather than to a column on tx_ident, and that is the fix for
// a real hole rather than a tidy-up. A contested parent is very often MINED, and a mined
// transaction has no identity row: the stamp moved it into tx_mined. The old UPDATE therefore
// matched nothing at all for exactly the parents that matter most, and it succeeded while
// doing so, because an UPDATE that touches no row is not an error.
//
// The 32-byte boundary test the old statement carried is gone with the packed column it
// guarded. One row per child cannot be matched straddling its neighbours, so the whole class
// of defect no longer exists rather than being defended against.
//
// ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING against the window's own unique index is what makes re-offering the
// same losing transaction free. See the schema comment for why that index is per window and
// why the reader still has to say DISTINCT.
//
// One ARRAY of parents, so a transaction reaching for coins of twenty parents is one
// statement. $1 is the height, $2 the parents, $3 the one child.

// offChainSinceAt decides whether a newly created transaction belongs in the mempool set.
//
// The rule is "was this transaction created because a block contains it". Block information
// present means mined, and a transaction cannot be mined and waiting to be mined at the same
// time. That is the same rule the sql store applies, which keys on whether any block info was
// supplied at all.
//
// This USED to additionally require the block information to claim the block was on the longest
// chain, on the reasoning that at create time the block is still being validated, so marking
// the transaction and letting a later stamp clear it failed in the safe direction. It did not
// fail safe, it failed at scale. The block-application path never claims the longest chain,
// because at that moment the claim would be untrue, so every transaction created by a sync was
// stored in both states at once. On the mainnet box that reached 3.8 million rows, 91% of the
// store, and the damage was not cosmetic: the pass that preserves the parents of transactions
// waiting to be mined walks that set, and it runs BEFORE the reclaim, so with millions of rows
// to walk it never finished and nothing was ever reclaimed. Disk grew without bound and the
// database was eventually killed for memory.
//
// The hazard the old rule was guarding against is real but is someone else's job. A transaction
// from a block that later loses is put back in the mempool set by the un-mine path, which sets
// the marker with a fresh clock taken from the current tip. That mechanism exists, is tested,
// and is what both reference stores rely on for the identical exposure.
