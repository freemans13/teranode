// SpendAndCreate spends the transaction's inputs and creates its outputs in ONE
// PostgreSQL transaction.
//
// This is the atomic implementation that utxo.SequentialSpendAndCreate exists to stand
// in for. The sequential helper must spend, then create, and on a create failure roll
// the spends back by calling Unspend with retries and exponential backoff — compensating
// logic that exists purely because the two halves cannot be made atomic in the stores it
// was written for.
//
// Here they can be, and the compensation disappears entirely. A spend is a DELETE and a
// create is an INSERT; issue both inside one transaction and a failure is a ROLLBACK, so
// the deletes simply never happened. There is no window in which the inputs are spent
// and the outputs are missing, no retry loop, and no dependence on Unspend — which
// matters for this store in particular, because its Unspend needs the spend journal.
//
// On ErrTxExists this is still all-or-nothing, and that is not a contract violation.
// The interface says the error is returned "with the spends left in place", which reads
// like a required partial commit but is not: if the transaction already exists then it
// was already processed, its inputs were already spent BY IT, and the spend phase wrote
// nothing. The postgres store makes that explicit -- its spend is
// ON CONFLICT (prev_tx_hash, prev_output_idx) DO NOTHING, so a re-spend is a no-op. So
// there is nothing to leave in place and nothing to undo, and a ROLLBACK reaches the
// same state a COMMIT would. Every path here is genuinely atomic.
//
// The store reaches that branch through tx_ident's primary key. Delete-on-spend has no
// spends row carrying spending_data, so a duplicate arrives as per-input ErrSpent from a
// DELETE affecting zero rows, which is indistinguishable from a genuine double spend.
// Identity answers it instead: the claim in createIn either inserts the row or reports
// that someone already holds this txid, and it does so without writing a coin row. One
// mechanism covers both arrival paths, the re-applied block and the duplicate mempool
// submission, which is what retires the applied_block ledger.
