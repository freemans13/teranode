// unspendSQL restores coins from the journal and CONSUMES the journal rows doing it.
//
// The journal row IS the authorisation. Deleting it as part of the restore makes the
// operation single-use: a second Unspend of the same outpoint finds no journal row to
// consume. That is what keeps invariant 5 intact -- the restore is authorised by the
// presence of a durable row, not by a counter that could drift. A counter drift is
// exactly what once stamped a live transaction and cascade-deleted it into a
// TX_NOT_FOUND wedge.
//
// A second call on an outpoint the first call already restored must be a no-op success,
// not an error -- BlockAssembler's conflict-intent WAL replay (stores/utxo/process_conflicting.go)
// depends on Unspend tolerating exactly this: a crash between a successful Unspend and the
// completion record for its intent means replay calls Unspend again on coins it already
// restored. The journal being single-use means that second call's DELETE matches nothing,
// which by itself is indistinguishable from the coin being genuinely unrestorable (its
// journal partition already reclaimed, or the outpoint re-spent by someone else since). The
// third output column resolves the ambiguity: it counts, from the state as it stood BEFORE this
// statement touched anything (every CTE here reads that same pre-statement snapshot,
// including live_before, so a key this call itself restores is not double-counted), how
// many requested keys already had a live coin at that ukey+txid. A key can be in `taken`
// (journal row existed and was consumed) or already live before the call, never both -- a
// coin cannot be simultaneously spent-and-journaled and live -- so restored+alreadyLive
// partitions the requested set cleanly between "this call did the work", "someone already
// did", and "genuinely gone". The check deliberately ignores which spender's undo made the
// coin live: the coin is unspent either way, so a replayed Unspend naming a different (or
// stale) spending_txid than whatever actually restored it is still the correct no-op --
// ownership only gates the journal consume, never the already-live short-circuit.
//
// Three predicates on the journal delete, each load-bearing:
//
//	j.ukey = i.ukey            locates candidates -- and is the journal's only index
//	j.txid = i.ptxid           full 32 bytes: the ukey is a non-unique 96-bit prefix and
//	                           can never establish identity on its own
//	j.spending_txid = i.stxid  THE OWNERSHIP TOKEN. A restore must name the spender that
//	                           actually took the coin. A stale reorg record whose output
//	                           has since been re-spent by a DIFFERENT transaction matches
//	                           nothing and is a no-op, rather than resurrecting a coin
//	                           that now belongs to someone else.
//
// The NOT EXISTS guard is belt-and-braces: with a non-unique key a concurrent re-create
// could otherwise produce a duplicate live row for one outpoint, which is counterfeit.
//
// $4 carries the flags to OR in, so a caller asking for flagAsLocked gets the coin back
// already locked rather than briefly spendable. IT REACHES BOTH OUTCOMES, the coin this call
// restores and the coin it found already live, and the second arm was missing.
//
// "Restore these coins AND hold them" is one instruction, and the hold is what stops anyone
// else spending a contested parent while conflict resolution decides which child gets it. ORing
// the flag only into the rows the INSERT produced meant a parent whose coin was already live
// came back unheld -- which is exactly the parent SetConflicting now names, and exactly the
// state a crash between the unspend and the lock leaves behind. That parent stayed spendable
// for the whole of the resolution and then had the driver's closing SetLocked(false) applied to
// it anyway, dropping any unrelated lock it happened to carry. The sql reference locks the
// transaction row unconditionally, which is why it has never had this gap.
//
// The locking arm is gated on $4 being non-zero, so an ordinary reorg restore, which asks for no
// hold, issues no update. It matches the live coin by its exact (leaf, ukey) with the full
// 32-byte txid rechecked -- the packed-key bound schema.go requires of every by-txid coin
// access -- and it cannot collide with the INSERT above: every CTE here reads the same
// pre-statement snapshot, so the rows this arm can see are precisely the ones `restored`
// excluded itself from touching.
//
// The restored coin's block facts are RE-RESOLVED, in three preferences, and the order is the
// immutability rule rather than a convenience.
//
// tx_mined first. Block facts can change after the spend was recorded -- a reorg can move a
// still-live parent to a different block -- so while the membership row exists it is the
// record that gets rewritten and the journal's copy is not. Reading it fresh by the parent's
// txid is what keeps a restore honest. ORDER BY seq LIMIT 1 picks the earliest row on the rare
// chance more than one exists (a coinbase re-org can leave a parent claimed at more than one
// height); seq is a global identity so "earliest" is well defined without touching mined_height.
//
// Then the journal's own copy, gated on mined_height > 0. Once the membership window has
// retired there is nothing left to re-resolve from, and before this the restore put back the
// unconfirmed sentinel on a coin that was demonstrably mined -- a coin claiming no block at
// all, which the read order would then answer from as if the transaction were in the mempool.
// The copy is safe to trust in exactly this case for the same reason readSpentParents is: a
// window that has retired is at least 1440 blocks deep and its block cannot change.
//
// Then 0, which is the unconfirmed sentinel and the correct answer for a parent that was
// genuinely unconfirmed when it was spent. Both columns move together in every branch, because
// each pair comes from one row.
