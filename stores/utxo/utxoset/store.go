	// Postgres must not JIT-compile this store's queries, and the reason is the row estimates
	// rather than anything about JIT itself.
	//
	// Every hot statement here hands its batch over as an array and unpacks it with unnest, so
	// the planner has no statistics for the values it will be given. It guesses, and because
	// every table is partitioned the guess is then multiplied by the partition count. On the
	// mainnet soak box the live-coin probe reads about twenty index pages and is costed at
	// 679,043, and the decorate read is costed at 1,465,539. Postgres compiles above 100,000 and inlines
	// and optimises above 500,000, so both clear every threshold on every execution.
	//
	// The compile is not the flat cost it looks like. The same statement took 1,430,530 ms, then
	// 499 ms on the very next execution in the same session, against 28 ms with JIT off. Nothing
	// caches compiled code between executions, so what varied was whether LLVM's own pages were
	// still resident. Under memory pressure they are not, and faulting them back in costs
	// minutes. At its best JIT makes this query eighteen times slower, at its worst fifty
	// thousand. There is no state in which it wins.
	//
	// This rides on the pool rather than the server because the blockchain store shares the same
	// postgres instance. Its heaviest statement is costed at 37,422, well under the threshold, so
	// it neither gains nor loses from JIT and should not have the choice made on its behalf.
	//
	// RuntimeParams travels in the startup packet, so a reconnect carries it too. jit is a
	// USERSET setting, which is what makes that legal.

	// Every statement is planned with its actual parameter values, every time. Never from a

	//
	// pgx prepares each statement once per connection and PostgreSQL, after the fifth
	// execution, switches a prepared statement to a generic plan if that plan's estimated cost
	// is no worse than the custom plans were. For this store's statements the estimate is
	// wrong in both places that matter. The batch arrives as arrays and is unpacked with
	// unnest, so a generic plan has no idea whether it is joining one key or five hundred. And
	// the eligibility tests on the coin row are bit masks on flags, which the planner cannot
	// estimate at all and costs as if almost no row survives them. Put together, the generic
	// plan can decide the coin table is a handful of rows worth rescanning per key.
	//
	// Measured on a 40,000-row coin table with the 500-key spend statement: executions one to
	// five took 8 ms each and the sixth took 1,070 ms, as did every one after it. That is the
	// generic plan taking over, and it turns a batch that should be linear in its width into
	// one that is quadratic. The single-key statement never showed it because with one key a
	// rescan is one scan.
	//
	// The custom plan costs about 0.2 ms of planning per execution, which a batch of hundreds
	// does not notice. This rides on the pool for the same reason jit does: the setting is
	// USERSET, travels in the startup packet, and does not touch the blockchain store sharing
	// the instance.
