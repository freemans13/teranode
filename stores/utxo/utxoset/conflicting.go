// conflictingInputsSQL reads what each named transaction spends, and proves the store holds it.
//
// It reads tx_inpoints rather than the serialized body for two reasons. The body is dropped
// once its window ages out, which is the ordinary steady state rather than an error, so a
// design resting on it would work for 288 blocks and then stop. And this store writes the body
// in plain rather than extended form, meaning its inputs carry no value or locking script, so
// even a body that is still present could not answer this.
//
// BOTH HOMES, because a transaction lives in exactly one of them and this statement does not
// know which. A transaction that lost a double-spend race is very often mined -- it arrives in
// a block on the fork being abandoned, and conflict resolution has to read what it spent so
// those spends can be undone -- and the longest-chain stamp moved its inpoints out of tx_ident
// and onto its membership row. Reading the identity table alone reported exactly those
// transactions as not held at all, so SetConflicting failed instead of resolving the race.
//
// The identity arm has THE LEAF AS A SCALAR and the txids as an array, so it runs once per leaf
// group: see leafGroups for the measurements that reject the other two key shapes. It replaced
// the paired `unnest(l[],t[]) JOIN tx_ident` form, whose plan flips with statistics.
//
// The membership arm puts the keys on the OUTSIDE of a LATERAL with an OFFSET 0 fence, the
// shape minedByTxidSQL and firstMinedRowSQL use, so it is one primary-key descent per key per
// live window rather than a hash join against every window read whole. The earliest row by seq
// is the transaction's longest-chain stamp, which is the row whose payload was carried over by
// the move; a later fork stamp only ever copies it.
//
// tx_inpoints IS NOT NULL makes a BLOCK-PATH membership row a not-found here, deliberately.
// Such a row records that a transaction is in a block, not what it spends, so it cannot be a
// conflict participant: only coinbases take that path at the tip, and below the checkpoint
// nothing conflicts. Reading it as "spends nothing" would be worse than refusing it, because an
// empty input set reports a transaction with no counter-spender at all, and that is the answer
// that lets a double spend through.
//
// A hash that comes back missing from both arms is the not-found answer.

// noteConflictingChildrenSQL records the contest on every parent whose coin is wanted.
//
// A transaction that loses a double-spend race is kept rather than discarded, because
// resolving the race later has to find it, and finding it means asking the PARENT whose coin
// was contested. Without this there is no route from a contested coin back to the transactions
// competing for it.
//
// It writes to conflict_children, keyed on the parent's txid alone, and that is what lets a
// MINED parent be contested. The row this used to update lived on tx_ident, which a mined
// transaction does not have -- the longest-chain stamp moved it into tx_mined -- so the note
// was a zero-row update for exactly the parents that matter, and silently succeeded.
//
// Two consequences of the move are worth stating, because both were rules here before. It no
// longer has to be a separate statement from the flag flip to avoid PostgreSQL's
// one-update-per-row-per-statement rule, since it updates no row; it stays separate because
// the note must go FIRST, so a note that fails leaves the transaction unmarked rather than
// marked but unfindable. And the 32-byte boundary test is gone with the packed column it
// guarded: one row per child cannot be matched straddling its neighbours.
//
// Run on BOTH values of the flag, matching both reference stores. Removing an entry is
// RemoveFromConflictingChildren's job.
//
// $1 is the height, $2 the parents and $3 the children, one element per (parent, child) pair.
// ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING against the window's own unique index makes a repeat free; the
// reader still says DISTINCT, because the index is per window. See the schema comment.

// setConflictingSQL flips the flag on both rows and reports both answers the caller needs.
//
// BOTH rows, for the reason setLockedSQL gives: the identity row is what a metadata read
// shows, the coin row is what the spend path reads, and the spend path never looks at the
// identity row. Moving only one leaves a transaction reporting itself conflicting while its
// coins stay spendable. The coin bit is what makes the spend statement's flag mask refuse the
// delete.
//
// The coin update is bounded by a key RANGE rather than by transaction id alone. The packed key
// carries the id prefix first precisely so this is an index range scan, and the full 32-byte id
// is still rechecked because the prefix is non-unique by design.
//
// The 'parent' rows are the spends to be undone, and they come from an INNER join on the
// journal deliberately. They feed straight into this store's own Unspend, which FAILS unless
// every record it is given comes back. So a record for an input that was never actually spent,
// or whose undo payload has aged out, is not a harmless extra: it makes the whole restore fail.
// Reporting only what the journal still holds is the only honest answer.
//
// The 'child' rows are the next level of the cascade. The journal is the only place this store
// can answer "who took this coin", because the coin row is destroyed the moment it is spent.
//
// The flag is flipped on THREE things, not two, for the same reason setLockedSQL flips three.
// A transaction lives in exactly one of tx_ident and tx_mined and this statement does not know
// which; a contested parent is very often mined, which is the whole reason the note itself
// became a side table. minedRow.toMeta reads Conflicting straight off tx_mined.flags, copied
// once by the move and updated by nothing afterwards, so without the membership arm marking a
// mined transaction conflicting set the coin bit and not the bit Get reports -- the mirror
// image of the failure setLockedSQL's own comment warns about. The membership arm is a plain
// txid equality because tx_mined's primary key leads with txid.
