// markOnLongestChainSQL moves transactions into or out of the mempool set, and reports which
// rows it actually reached.
//
// One statement of arrays, so repairing a thousand transactions costs the same round trip as
// repairing one. RETURNING is not decoration here: the caller is fixing an inconsistency, and
// a row that was silently skipped leaves that inconsistency in place, so it has to know which
// rows moved.
//
// off_chain_since is the only column this touches. Block membership is NOT rewritten, because
// this call does not claim to know which blocks a transaction is in. It answers one narrower
// question, which is whether the chain the node currently believes in contains it.
//
// THE LEAF IS A SCALAR AND THE TXIDS AN ARRAY, so this runs once per leaf group. See
// leafGroups: it is the only key shape here whose cost is a function of the batch rather than
// of the mempool, and txid = ANY is exact on its own because tx_ident_ck makes leaf a function
// of txid.

// windows those rows will land in have to be created before the transaction opens, since the

// It is moveToMinedSQL with the parameters removed, and the removal is the point. The stamp

// block's packed triple and write the parameters straight through. This call is told nothing
// but "the chain now contains these transactions", so the only block it can name is the one
// the row already claims -- which is sound only when the row claims exactly one. A row naming
// two stays where it is with its marker cleared, because nothing here can say which of them is
// main; it waits for an un-mine or a further stamp to reduce it to one. A row carrying
// conflicting children stays for the reason moveToMinedSQL leaves it: tx_mined has no column
// for that bookkeeping yet.
//
// The height, block id and subtree index are decoded big-endian from the twelve bytes, in the

//
// $3 is the LOWEST HEIGHT still covered by a membership window, and a row naming anything
// below it is left exactly where it is. Its window has been dropped and cannot be recreated:
// the floor exists to stop a retired window claiming its transactions afresh and doubling every
// coin still live in it. A single-block row that old is ordinary fork residue -- roughly 300
// blocks of it is what block assembly's startup reload hands this call -- so refusing to settle
// it must not refuse the marker clear for every other hash in the batch. See markOnAndSettle.
//
// One leaf group at a time, for the reason spelled out on leafGroups, and the same

//
// The call now MOVES rows as well as marking them, in both directions, and it has to: the
// mempool table and the membership table are the two halves of one set, and a transaction is
// in whichever half matches what the node last learned about the chain. On the longest chain
// with exactly one block claimed, the row settles into the membership table. Off the longest

// as fork triples. Marking a row without moving it would leave a settled transaction that
// nothing can un-mine, and an un-mined one that no unmined-transaction reload can find.
