// The batched form of SpendAndCreate.
//
// Every production caller of this store arrives through SpendAndCreate, and until this file
// existed each call opened its own PostgreSQL transaction: one BEGIN, a spend statement with a
// plan of one, a create statement with a plan of one, one COMMIT. On the mainnet box that was
// 15,000 commits a second, and postgres spent its time on the locks every commit must take,
// assigning a transaction id and reserving and flushing WAL, rather than on the rows. Both
// statements were written to take arrays. Nothing fed them more than one.
//
// This batcher does. Callers arriving from many goroutines are applied together in ONE
// transaction: one spend statement carrying every input of every item, one create statement
// carrying every item, one commit. Per-commit cost is divided by the batch width and
// durability is untouched, which is the whole point: it is the same win that turning fsync off
// would buy, obtained without turning anything off.
//
// The contract is that each caller receives exactly the answer the single-transaction path
// would have given it. Where that cannot be arranged inside the batch, the item is handed to
// the single path rather than approximated, and it is handed over in the state it arrived in.

// spendAndCreateBatchByteBudget bounds the serialized bytes one batch transaction carries.
//
// The batcher counts items, not bytes, and a PostgreSQL parameter cannot exceed a gigabyte.
// A batch of large transactions would fail its statement deterministically and be redone as
// singles at twice the cost, and long before that it would hold every body in memory twice.
// So a flushed batch is cut into chunks under this budget, each its own transaction. At the
// usual few hundred bytes per transaction the budget is never reached and a flush is one chunk.
// A variable rather than a constant so a test can force the split.

// that is run a second time therefore no longer carries its own claim, and a forged one would

// newSpendAndCreateBatcher wires SpendAndCreate through the shared batcher.
//
// Dispatch is backgrounded and bounded, unlike the create batcher's, because this is the
// production write path and one batch per round trip on one goroutine would trade the callers'
// parallelism, which is in the hundreds, for one. The concurrency bound is the same setting
// the aerospike store applies to all of its batchers. Each in-flight batch holds exactly one
// pool connection and takes no second one while it holds it, so the bound need only stay
// below the pool size to be safe.
//
// Drain mode, always. The batcher then fires whatever has queued the moment its worker is
// free, so a batch is as wide as the load and never waits on a timer, and the configured size
// is a cap rather than a target. A fixed window is the wrong shape for this path whatever its
// length: below the batch size it turns the callers' parallel commits into one serial commit
// per window, and measured against the single-transaction path on a local instance it lost at
// every concurrency below the batch width. Transactions a second, 20,000 transactions,
// batch cap 500, 16 concurrent batches:
//
//	callers    single    25 ms window    1 ms window    drain
//	    16      7,095             426          3,079    7,096

//
// Drain mode is the only column that never loses, and at high concurrency it wins by the most,
// because it keeps every worker busy instead of waiting for a batch to fill or a timer to
// fire. The duration setting therefore has no effect on this batcher.
//
// The partition hazard that kept the create batcher serial does not apply. Both partition
// creators take a process-wide mutex and are called before the transaction is opened, so two
