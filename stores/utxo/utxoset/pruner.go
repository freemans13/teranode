// journalPruner drops what has aged out, and reads nothing to decide it.
//
// There is no DAH sweep here and no pile of spent rows to walk. The DELETE that spends an
// output frees its space and its index entry in the same statement that authorises the
// spend, so the reclaim that dominated the previous store does not exist: its sweep,
// pruner and the vacuum they forced together measured 76.7% of all disk reads and 52% of
// statement write-ahead log volume, with the watermark thousands of blocks behind the tip.
//
// What is left is catalog operations on two horizons. Transaction bodies retire on
// DefaultTxBodyRetentionBlocks; membership windows, the spend journal and the
// conflict-bookkeeping windows created alongside its leaves retire on
// DefaultSpendJournalRetentionBlocks. Each is a DROP TABLE of partitions that have aged out,
// so there is no work list, no probe and no per-row cost that can fall behind.
//
// Identity reclaim used to be the expensive half of this: a retiring journal partition read
// as a work list, each parent judged on whether its spenders were settled, and its identity
// row deleted. That is gone. A mined transaction claims on tx_mined instead of tx_ident, and
// its coins carry the height and block that made them, so retiring its membership is dropping
// the window it lives in.
//
// It runs HERE, rather than on the spend path where it used to, for three reasons. The
// spend path had to swallow the error to avoid failing a spend over old history, and it
// swallowed a real one for the entire life of the branch. DETACH CONCURRENTLY waits for
// every open transaction on the parent, which from inside a spend stalls the pipeline.
// And services/pruner/worker.go already provides exactly the trigger this needs: once per
// block, off its own single-threaded goroutine, with the returned error logged at Errorf
// against a metric and the call timed. Nothing had to be built to get that.
//
// Inherited from that worker, and worth knowing rather than discovering: it gates on block
// assembly being caught up, skips heights at or below pruner_min_block_height, and
// deduplicates to the latest notification when it falls behind. So a session can be
// skipped or can jump several leaves at once. Every drop here absorbs that -- one call
// drops every partition below the cutoff, not one per call -- so a skipped block defers
// the drop rather than losing it, and the store simply carries more history until the
// next session lands.
