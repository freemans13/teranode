// BatchDecorate fills in metadata for many transactions at once.
//
// A transaction the store does not hold is reported on ITS OWN entry, not by failing the
// call. The validator turns a missing parent into a rejection for that transaction alone, so
// failing the batch would reject every transaction that happened to be resolved beside it.
//
// The field list is accepted and ignored with one exception, as it is on the single read:
// whichever step answers returns every column it holds on one row, so narrowing the projection
// would save a little on the wire and hand the caller a partly populated record it might
// dereference. The exception is the contest, which is not on that row at all -- it is keyed on
// the txid in conflict_children, because a contested parent is usually mined -- so it costs a
// statement and is read only when named.
//
// The read order lives in lookupMany, which this, Get and the get batcher all go through, so
// there is one answer to "where does a transaction come from" rather than three.

// setLockedSQL flips the locked bit on the transaction row AND on every coin it created.
//
// Both, because they are read by different things. The transaction row is what a caller sees
// through Get; the coin row is what the spend path reads, and the spend path never looks at
// the transaction row. Setting only one would leave a transaction reporting itself locked
// while its coins were still spendable, or the reverse.
//
// "The transaction row" is EITHER home, so there are three arms rather than two. A transaction
// lives in exactly one of tx_ident and tx_mined, this call does not know which, and
// minedRow.toMeta reads Locked straight off tx_mined.flags -- copied once by the move and
// updated by nothing afterwards. Without the membership arm a flag set after the stamp was
// invisible to Get, silently, and in the direction that matters: a transaction reporting itself
// locked forever. The two-phase-commit release ordinarily runs long before the stamp, so this
// is narrow, but narrow and silent is the combination worth closing.
//
// The membership arm is a plain txid equality because tx_mined's primary key LEADS with txid,
// so it is one descent per key per live window, and the update touches every membership row the
// transaction has -- a transaction stamped into two blocks is one transaction and one flag.
//
// The coin UPDATE carries the packed-key range, AND it locates its rows through a fenced
// LATERAL first. schema.go states the rule in its own words: "There is deliberately no index on
// txid: every by-txid access is a ukey range scan with a full-txid heap recheck. Any query
// filtering on txid without a ukey range bound is a review failure." This was that query, on
// the two-phase-commit path, one call per mempool transaction, and every sibling statement --
// setConflictingSQL, deleteTxSQL, resetCoinsSQL, stampCoinsSQL, coinFactsSQL -- already carried
// lo/hi. The answer was never wrong, because the full txid was already rechecked.
//
// The bound alone does not buy the plan. Measured at 500 keys against 40,000 coin rows: with
// the range added straight to `UPDATE utxo u FROM k`, the planner still hash-joined the keys
// against a Seq Scan of all eight leaf partitions and applied the range as a Join Filter --
// 13.5-14.1 ms, the same plan as without it. That is exactly what resetCoinsSQL's comment
// records ("the obvious UPDATE ... FROM unnest read all eight coin partitions for 98 ms of a
// 108 ms statement"), so this takes resetCoinsSQL's shape: a CTE that locates the rows through
// a CROSS JOIN LATERAL with an OFFSET 0 fence, then an UPDATE keyed on what it found. The fence
// is what stops the subquery being pulled up into the join, which is what re-admits the scan.
// No LIMIT inside it, because a transaction has as many coins as it has unspent outputs and all
// of them take the flag. Measured, eight runs at 500 keys against 40,000 coin rows: 13.2-14.5 ms
// with the bound as a Join Filter, 8.5-9.9 ms fenced, with a Bitmap Index Scan on each leaf's
// ukey index and no Seq Scan on any coin partition.
//
// Most of what is left is the ident arm above, which is still the paired-unnest join shape:
// 6.4 ms of the 8.7, a Hash Join over a Seq Scan of all eight identity partitions. That is the
// shape leafGroups measures and rejects (set_mined.go), and it is worth revisiting here -- but
// the reshape makes tx_ident mempool-sized rather than the 40,000 rows this was measured at, so
// it is a throughput item and not a correctness one.
