// claimMismatch compares what a spending transaction CLAIMED about the coin against what the
// store has just handed back for it, and returns the rejection when they differ.
//
// This is the control the other two stores get from the UTXO hash, and the reason that hash
// has content. A transaction may be submitted in EXTENDED FORMAT, meaning it carries its own
// copy of every coin it spends -- the coin's value in satoshis and its locking script, the
// rules for who may move it. The validator deliberately does not re-derive those when they
// arrive; it validates against whatever the transaction brought. So the no-inflation check
// sums the submitter's satoshis and script verification runs against the submitter's script.
// The hash the other two stores compare at the spend is computed from those carried copies,
// which is what makes it an authentication of the SUBMITTER rather than a consistency check on
// the store.
//
// This store needs no hash to do the same job. Its DELETE returns the coin's real satoshis and
// script in the same round trip, because the spend is also the decorate fetch, so it holds the
// truth at exactly the moment the other two are comparing digests. Comparing the values
// directly is cheaper -- a byte comparison instead of a double hash per input, on the hottest
// path in the store -- and strictly stronger, because it compares the values themselves rather
// than a digest of them.
//
// A nil PreviousTxScript means the input carried no claim at all, which is the un-decorated
// below-checkpoint outpoint-only path. There is nothing to authenticate, and that path
// switches script validation off in the same breath, so nothing acts on a claim either.
//
// The error is deliberately the one the other two stores already raise for this condition.
// Their needsSpendRollback reads it as a genuine invalidity rather than a transient failure,
// and conflict resolution reads it as "this transaction is invalid" rather than "this
// transaction lost a race" -- so a false claim is rejected outright instead of being kept as a
// conflicting transaction whose descendants get walked.
//
// Rejection is all-or-nothing on every path a caller can reach in production: SpendAndCreate
// runs the spend inside one database transaction and rolls it back on any per-input error, and
// SpendAndCreate is the only entry point the validator, block validation and conflict
// resolution use. The batched Spend path has no enclosing transaction, so a rejected
// transaction there leaves the rows the DELETE already took. That is a pre-existing property
// of that path for every error class, not something this comparison introduces, and no caller
// outside tests reaches it.
// The skipClaim decision is a PARAMETER rather than a gate at the call site, and that is the
// point of it being here. It used to be an if around the whole call, written independently of
// the reassignment check inside; the two then interacted silently, and an outpoint-only spend
// of a reassigned coin was authenticated by nothing at all. One function decides now, so the

// parentKnownSQL asks, for a set of outpoints, whether the store holds the parent transaction
// at all -- in any of the four places it can be held.
//
// Each probe sits inside a LATERAL with an OFFSET 0 fence, the shape minedByTxidSQL and
// firstMinedRowSQL use, so each is one index descent per key rather than a subquery the
// planner is free to pull up and hash against the whole table. Written as four ORed EXISTS
// clauses the planner does exactly that: measured elsewhere in this store on 40,000 coins, an
// unfenced EXISTS over the coin table planned as a hashed SubPlan across every leaf partition.
//
// The coin probe is bounded by the packed-key RANGE and rechecked on the full 32-byte txid,
// which schema.go requires of every by-txid coin access, and it asks about ANY output of the
// parent rather than the one being spent: a parent whose membership window has retired is
// known to this store only through a surviving coin, which is exactly what a pruned SV Node
// can say about one.

// nameUnknownParents downgrades ErrSpent to ErrTxNotFound for the inputs whose parent this
// store has never held.
//
// The two are not interchangeable to the caller. ErrSpent means a competing transaction took
// the coin, and the validator answers it by marking the loser conflicting and walking its
// descendants. ErrTxNotFound means the parent has not arrived, and the validator answers it by
// fetching the parent and retrying. Reporting the first for an outpoint the store has never
// seen makes the node declare a double spend against a transaction that does not exist, which
// is both wrong and unrecoverable without operator action. Both reference stores distinguish
// them, because both read the parent's record before they touch a coin.
//
// This store does not read the parent's record on the spend path, deliberately -- the spend IS
// the read, straight off the coin, and that is where its speed comes from. So the question is
// asked only here, for the inputs nothing else could explain: no live coin, and no journal row
// naming a spender. That is the error path, never the hot one.
//
// ONE CASE STAYS AMBIGUOUS, and it is reported as spent rather than missing. A parent whose
// membership window has retired, whose coins are all gone, and whose spend is older than
// journal retention leaves no trace here at all, so it is indistinguishable from one that
// never arrived. Answering "not found" there is the conservative choice: it asks the caller to
// fetch a parent rather than to condemn a transaction as a double spend on no evidence.
