// SpendJournalPartitionBlocks is the width of one journal leaf. The pruner drops whole leaves,
// so retention is granular to this. At the measured frontier (~20,000 spends/block) a leaf
// holds roughly 960,000 rows.
const SpendJournalPartitionBlocks = 48

// DefaultSpendJournalRetentionBlocks is how far back a spend stays undoable.
//
// 1440, not the 288 the design originally proposed. ParentPreservationBlocks is 1440 and
// its own settings documentation says in bold "DO NOT reduce below 1440 as this risks
// invalidating legitimate transaction resubmissions" -- so a 288-block journal would
// have compiled, passed tests, and then silently failed to protect a resubmitted
// transaction ten days later. The measured UTXO growth slope (251/block, not the 802
// assumed) leaves the budget at roughly 60-66% even at this depth, so the correct number
// is affordable.
//
// Steady-state leaf count is retention/SpendJournalPartitionBlocks + 1 = 31 tables. Bounded, and
// dropped as the chain advances.
const DefaultSpendJournalRetentionBlocks = 1440

// spendJournalSQL deletes the UTXO row AND captures its payload in one statement.
//
// One statement, not merely one transaction. A data-modifying CTE guarantees the delete
// and the journal insert see the same rows and commit together -- there is no ordering,
// no second round trip, and no window in which a coin is gone with nothing recording how
// to put it back. The outer SELECT still returns satoshis and script, so the spend
// remains its own decorate fetch.
//
// Every parameter is an ARRAY, including the height and the spending transaction, so one
// statement serves one transaction or a thousand. That is what lets the spend path batch
// without a second copy of these predicates existing somewhere: the single-transaction path
// is a batch of one.
//
// This is now the ONLY spend statement. There was a journal-free twin of it, used below
// the checkpoint, whose predicates had to be kept identical by hand; it is deleted rather
// than flagged off, because two copies of a consensus predicate is a defect waiting for
// one of them to be edited. The predicates that authorise the delete are the full 32-byte
// txid recheck (the ukey is a non-unique 96-bit prefix and can only locate, never
// authorise), the frozen and conflicting flag masks, and the maturity test. classifySQL
// deliberately omits the last three, so an excluded row surfaces as frozen or immature
// rather than as spent.
//
// The flag test is written (flags & 5) < 1 and not (flags & 1) = 0 AND (flags & 4) = 0,
// which it is equal to for every value a smallint can hold, because the planner can estimate
// one and not the other. It has no statistics for a bit-mask expression, so an equality on
// one is given the default selectivity of one row in two hundred, and two of them one in
// forty thousand. That told the planner almost no coin survives the test, and with a batch
// of keys on the other side it chose to walk the whole coin table once PER KEY, since a
// table of one row is cheap to walk. Measured on a 40,000-row table: a 64-key batch took
// 3 ms until the table crossed the size where that plan won, then 45 ms, and with
// materialisation disabled 180 ms. An inequality on an expression without statistics is
// given one third, which is wrong by three rather than by forty thousand, and it is enough
// for the planner to reach for the index or hash the batch instead. The single-key form of
// this statement never showed the problem, because with one key a walk per key is one walk.
//
// The journal row copies the coin's mined_height and block_id along with the rest of the
// payload, and they cost nothing extra: the DELETE already carries the whole row, so this is
// two more columns on a RETURNING that was already reading them. They are what makes a
// fully-spent parent older than the membership retention still answerable -- see
// readSpentParents in lookup.go and the spend_journal comment in schema.go. Placeholders are
// unchanged at $1..$6, because both values come off the deleted row rather than from the
// caller.
