// PreserveTransactions marks transactions to be preserved from deletion.

//
// PRUNE-ELIGIBILITY GATE: only transactions that already carry a delete_at_height
// stamp (eligible now), OR are already being preserved (preserve_until set, so a
// still-needed preservation can be renewed each cycle even though the first
// preservation cleared the DAH), are preserved. A tx with neither is not fully
// spent, so it is not at risk of pruning and there is nothing to protect —
// preserving it would be pointless work, and it is exactly the not-fully-spent
// input that the expiry path could otherwise turn into a bad deletion stamp.
//
// Postgres note: delete_at_height is set by the BACKGROUND sweep (dah_sweep.go),
// which can lag behind a tx becoming fully spent. So a freshly-fully-spent parent
// may have no DAH yet when a pruner cycle runs and be skipped here — that is benign:
// the sweep stamps it shortly after, and because the stamp is a FUTURE height
// (completion+1+retention) the pruner will not act for `retention` blocks, during
// which the next pruner cycle re-admits and re-preserves it. ProcessExpiredPreservations
// is the setter-side safety net for the case where a preserved (eligible) tx is later
// un-spent by a reorg.

// ProcessExpiredPreservations handles transactions whose preservation period has
// expired. For each tx with preserve_until <= currentHeight it clears preserve_until,
// and sets delete_at_height ONLY when the tx is genuinely safe to drop.
//
// Upholding the invariant "delete_at_height set ⟹ safe to delete": preservation can
// be requested for any parent of an old unmined tx, including a parent that is not
// fully spent (e.g. one output spent by a now-resolved mempool child, another output
// still live). Stamping such a parent for deletion would let the pruner — which
// deletes purely on the stamp (see the DESIGN CONTRACT in
// pruner_provider.deleteTombstonedPartition) — remove a tx that still has live UTXOs.
//
// The eligibility CASE mirrors the sweep's conditions (the canonical DAH setter):
//   - conflicting txs get a DAH (they need not be mined); else
//   - on the longest chain (unmined_since IS NULL) AND mined (has block_ids) AND fully
//     spent.
//
// Setter-C reconcile (proc v15): fully-spentness is decided from the MAINTAINED
// spent_bits bitmap (spendable_count > 0 AND bit_count(spent_bits) = spendable_count),
// NOT from a per-row count(*) re-aggregation over the spends table. This matches the
// sweep proc (dah_sweep_proc.go) and SetMinedMulti (mined.go), so all three DAH setters
// agree on "fully spent". The bitmap OR is idempotent, so bit_count can never overshoot
// spendable_count — no ground-truth recount is needed to trust the gate.
//
// LAGGING-BITMAP RULE: the bitmap is folded by the BACKGROUND sweep, which lags the
// tip by dahSafeTip's lag. A parent that just became fully spent may still show
// bit_count(spent_bits) < spendable_count when its preservation expires (the sweep
// has not yet folded its last spend). In that case this path deliberately does NOT
// stamp — it clears preserve_until and leaves delete_at_height NULL. That is SAFE: an
// unstamped tx is never pruned, and the sweep stamps it (completion+1+retention, a
// FUTURE height) once the fold catches up. Stamping "early" off a lagging bitmap would
// risk a wrong height; not stamping only defers reclaim by at most a sweep cycle. This
// upholds the invariant "delete_at_height set ⟹ genuinely fully spent" without ever
// leaving a not-yet-fully-spent tx stamped.
//
// An ineligible tx just has preserve_until cleared, delete_at_height left NULL; the
// sweep re-stamps it if/when it actually becomes eligible. This runs once per pruner
// cycle over only the small set of expiring preservations (gated by px_preserve_until),
// so it reads only two row-local columns (no spends join) off the hot delete path.
