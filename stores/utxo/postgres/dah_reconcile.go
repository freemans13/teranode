// dahReconcileAuditChain is the truth-recompute + correction CTE chain shared by
// the rotating-slice audit and the dirty-parents drain. The caller supplies a
// preceding CTE named `slice_txs` (the candidate parents, with spent_bits,
// out_count, out_spendables, gates, ...) and its own final SELECT; the chain is
// spliced between them. Sprintf verbs: %[1]s = partition leaf suffix,
// %[2]s = safe-tip parameter placeholder, %[3]s = retention parameter placeholder
// (the two call sites number their positional parameters differently).
//
// The chain recomputes each candidate's TRUE spent bitmap from the spends table
// (ground truth) and corrects the stored row where it disagrees:
//
//	byte_agg — per (parent, byte index) integer mask of the parent's SPENDABLE
//	           spends up to the safe tip: byte i/8 gets bit 1<<(i%8), the same
//	           LSB-first get_bit encoding as out_spendables/spent_bits. The
//	           spendability test mirrors the fold (CASE-guarded so get_bit is
//	           never evaluated out of range: prev_output_idx < out_count AND
//	           get_bit(out_spendables, idx) = 1).
//	truth    — per-parent BYTEA mask, width-stable at exactly (out_count+7)/8
//	           bytes: gap bytes are zero-filled SET-WISE (LATERAL series + LEFT
//	           JOIN — not a correlated subquery per parent), so a parent with NO
//	           qualifying spends gets the all-zero mask of that width. LEFT JOIN
//	           LATERAL keeps zero-output parents (empty series → gs.i IS NULL →
//	           FILTER drops it → COALESCE yields the empty '\x' mask, matching
//	           the zero-byte spent_bits create pre-sizes for out_count = 0).
//	           true_last_spend = max spent_at_height over the qualifying spends.
//	drift    — candidates whose stored row disagrees with truth. spent_bits from
//	           create is pre-sized to (out_count+7)/8 but rows written only by
//	           the fold can be SHORTER (the fold masks stop at the highest folded
//	           byte); missing trailing bytes mean zero, so the stored value is
//	           zero-padded to the truth width before the IS DISTINCT FROM —
//	           otherwise every short-but-equal row would count as drift forever.
//	           (repeat('00', n) with n clamped ≥ 0; a stored value LONGER than
//	           truth — impossible under the spent_bits ⊆ out_spendables
//	           invariant — still compares distinct and is rewritten to truth.)
//	upd      — SET spent_bits to the true mask (authoritative REPLACE, not an OR:
//	           the whole point is clearing wrongly-set bits) and last_spend_height
//	           to the true last spend, stamping / un-stamping delete_at_height
//	           per the CASE (see the function comments).
//	ins/del  — mirror the stamp changes into pending_deletes (the only pruner
//	           feed): freshly-completed stamps upserted, cleared stamps purged.

// reconcileSpentBitsPartition runs one BOUNDED reconciliation pass over a single
// hash partition. It is the bitmap-recompute backstop for the MAINTAINED
// txs.spent_bits bitmap: the v15 fold is idempotent (duplicate ORs are no-ops),
// so the old counter-drift classes are structurally gone, but bits can still go
// wrong in ways the fold can never self-correct — the fold-vs-Unspend
// stale-snapshot race can re-set a just-cleared bit (primary heal: the
// dah_dirty_parents drain below; this audit is the defence-in-depth for a lost
// queue row), and any unforeseen corruption (torn write, operator surgery)
// persists forever in a maintained column. This pass restores the self-healing
// property, bounded so it never costs O(all history).
//
// Bounding: it selects at most `slice` txs from the partition, resuming from a
// per-partition rotating cursor (dah_reconcile_cursor.last_hash) ordered by hash,
// so successive passes rotate through the whole partition a slice at a time. When
// a pass returns fewer than `slice` rows it has reached the partition's end and
// the cursor wraps to the start. Per-tx recompute is O(that tx's spends), so the
// whole pass is O(slice + spends of those slice txs) — never the full chain.
//
// For each tx in the slice it recomputes the TRUE spent bitmap directly from the
// spends table using the SAME spendable predicate the fold uses
// (prev_output_idx < out_count AND get_bit(out_spendables, prev_output_idx)=1):
//
//   - true_bits       = byte-level mask of that tx's spendable-output spends,
//     width-stable at (out_count+7)/8 bytes (all-zero when none)
//   - true_last_spend = max(spent_at_height) over those spends
//
// Where the stored bitmap (or last_spend_height) differs it CORRECTS it, and —
// mirroring the fold's stamp — if the correction makes the bits complete
// (bit_count(true_bits) = spendable_count) on a mined, not-yet-stamped,
// unpreserved (unmined_since IS NULL) tx it also stamps delete_at_height =
// GREATEST(true_last_spend, mined_at_height)+1+retention and upserts it into
// pending_deletes (catching a previously-missed completion). It respects the
// same mined/preserve/unmined gates as the fold, so an unmined fully-spent tx is
// corrected but left unstamped (the mine path owns that stamp).
//
// It also UN-STAMPS in the reverse direction (defense-in-depth): a tx carrying a
// delete_at_height while it is NOT actually fully spent (bit_count(true_bits) <
// spendable_count) has that premature/stale stamp CLEARED and is removed from
// pending_deletes — otherwise the pruner (which deletes purely on the stamp)
// would delete a tx with a live UTXO. Legitimate not-fully-spent stamps are
// preserved: conflicting (double-spend loser) and preserved (preserve_until) txs
// are excluded, as is the zero-spendable case (spendable_count = 0).
//
// Because it REPLACES the bitmap with the recompute rather than OR-ing a delta,
// wrongly-set AND wrongly-clear bits are both fixed in one pass regardless of
// how they arose.
//
// safeTip bounds spends to spent_at_height <= safeTip, matching the fold's safe
// window (no spend still mid-commit is counted). retention is the same block-height
// retention the fold uses. Returns the number of rows whose stored values were
// corrected (drift found). The pass runs in one autocommit statement per
// partition; it is a background/maintenance path (never on the hot path).
//
// Serialization against the sweep: the audit statement opens with a `gate` CTE
// that takes pg_try_advisory_xact_lock(20240684 + partition) — the SAME key the
// sweep proc takes per band. Because the query is one autocommit statement, the
// lock is held for exactly its duration, so the reconciler and the sweep can
// never hold intersecting locks on the same partition's txs rows (the deadlock
// this closes). When the sweep already holds the partition the gate is closed,
// every data-modifying CTE downstream (which all derive from the now-empty
// `slice_txs`) becomes a no-op, and the call returns skipped=true with
// corrected=0 WITHOUT advancing or wrapping the rotating cursor: a naive skip
// that returned seen=0 would look identical to "partition exhausted" to the
// wrap logic below and would reset the rotation to the head on every contended
// tick, starving the tail of the partition forever. Skipping the cursor update
// entirely means the next tick simply retries the same slice.

// (a fold statement whose band snapshot predates a concurrent Unspend commit
// re-sets a just-cleared bit) is healed within ~one reconcile tick — the
// rotating audit alone rotates far too slowly to be the safety story for
// wrongly-full bits.
//
// Ordering is the whole correctness argument, so it is spelled out:
//
// The drain is ONE transaction of TWO statements: (1) DELETE the queue rows
// RETURNING their hashes, then (2) recompute + correct those parents. Under
// READ COMMITTED each statement takes its OWN snapshot, so the recompute's
// snapshot is taken strictly AFTER the delete executed. That order closes the
// lost-re-dirty race:
//
//   - An Unspend that commits BEFORE statement (2)'s snapshot is simply SEEN by
//     the recompute — its cleared bits are ground truth here.
//   - An Unspend that commits after that snapshot re-enqueues the parent: its
//     INSERT ... ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING either finds no queue row (ours is
//     already deleted-and-committed → plain insert) or finds our
//     deleted-but-uncommitted row, blocks on our transaction in the speculative
//     -insert conflict check, and — once our delete COMMITS — no longer
//     conflicts with the dead tuple, so it INSERTS a fresh row. Either way the
//     parent is back in the queue and the next tick heals it with a snapshot
//     that does see the Unspend.
//
// Deleting LAST (after the recompute) would be wrong: an Unspend committing
// between the recompute's snapshot and the delete would DO-NOTHING against the
// still-live queue row, our delete would then eat it, and the re-dirty — which
// our stale recompute did not see — would be lost forever. A single-statement
// CTE (DELETE ... RETURNING feeding the recompute) has the same hole in
// miniature: all CTEs share ONE snapshot taken before the DELETE executes, so
// an Unspend committing in that gap is both invisible to the recompute and
// swallowed by the delete. Two statements, delete first, is the only shape
// where every Unspend is either seen or re-queued.
//
// Residual hazard (accepted, self-healing): our lock order is queue row →
// parent txs row, while a concurrent Unspend of a drained parent holds the txs
// row and then touches the queue — a 40P01 deadlock is possible. Postgres
// aborts one side; if it is us the whole transaction (including the queue
// delete) rolls back, so no queue row is lost and the next tick retries. Rare:
// it needs an Unspend of that exact parent mid-drain (reorg path).
//
// It takes the same per-partition advisory lock as the sweep and the rotating
