	//
	// ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
	// DESIGN CONTRACT — read before "fixing" this delete.
	//
	// This is deliberately a DUMB, lightweight index range-delete: it removes every
	// tx whose delete_at_height has been reached and does NOT re-check whether the
	// tx is really mined / fully-spent / on-longest-chain / not-preserved. Reviewers
	// (and static analysis) repeatedly flag the missing re-check as a data-loss bug
	// and add a per-row eligibility gate here — that was tried and reverted. DO NOT
	// re-add it. Re-counting each candidate's spends on the hottest reclaim path
	// measurably cuts throughput, and the whole point of the deferred-DAH design is
	// to keep the fully-spent test OFF the hot path. (delete_at_height is also always
	// a FUTURE height = completion + 1 + retention, so a reached stamp means the tx
	// settled `retention` blocks ago.)
	//
	// Correctness lives with the DAH SETTERS. Their invariant: set delete_at_height
	// ONLY while a tx is genuinely safe to drop, and CLEAR it the instant it is not:
	//   • dah_sweep.go — stamps only mined+fully-spent+on-longest-chain+not-preserved;
	//     clears the stamp when a tx stops qualifying.
	//   • Unspend (spend.go) — a reorg revives an output → clears the stamp.
	//   • MarkTransactionsOnLongestChain(false) (conflicting.go) — a tx leaves the
	//     longest chain → clears the stamp.
	//   • PreserveTransactions / PreserveParentsOfOldUnminedTransactions — protect a
	//     parent of an unmined child by setting preserve_until (which clears the
	//     stamp), so it is not pruned while the child is unmined; PreserveTransactions
	//     only preserves already-eligible txs.
	//   • ProcessExpiredPreservations (preservation.go) — on expiry, re-stamps only
	//     when still eligible (conflicting, or mined+fully-spent+on-longest-chain),
	//     else clears preserve_until with the stamp left NULL.
	// If you change any code that writes delete_at_height, THAT is where eligibility
	// belongs — not here.
	//
	// Reorg vs prune — a known race we deliberately do NOT defend against here:
	// In theory the pruner could delete a tx at the same instant a reorg Unspend
	// revives it. In practice the two can never touch the same tx. A tx only becomes
	// prune-eligible `retention` blocks after it settled (delete_at_height =
	// completion + 1 + retention; see above), whereas a realistic reorg is 1–2 blocks
	// deep — so a prune-eligible tx is hundreds of blocks older than the deepest block
	// any reorg can reach. The prune-eligible set and the reorg-reachable set overlap
	// ONLY if retention is configured below the reorg depth, i.e. a catastrophic
	// misconfiguration. (Default retention is ~2 days of blocks.)
	//
	// We intentionally keep this simple rather than chase the window: a delete-time
	// re-check of delete_at_height is only a one-sided half-guard (it does nothing
	// when the DELETE wins the race and the later Unspend finds no row to revive), and
	// truly serialising prune against reorg is real complexity for a state the
	// retention margin already makes unreachable. The one invariant that keeps us safe:
	//
	//     retention MUST stay well above the deepest expected reorg.
	//
	// Hold that and this is a non-issue. Do NOT add per-row delete-time guards back.
	// ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
	// Doomed candidates are enumerated from the pending_deletes side-table (the only
	// pruner path): a tiny, append-only table indexed by delete_at_height, so the
