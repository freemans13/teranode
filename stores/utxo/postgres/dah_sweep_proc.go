// dahSweepProcVersion is bumped whenever dahSweepProcDDL changes. bootstrap
// recreates the procedure whenever the version stored in dah_sweep_control
// differs (in EITHER direction, so a binary rollback reinstalls the older body).
//
// Bumped 9→10: row-targeted batching (LIMIT batch_rows on the stamped set,
// loop-until-short-pass, single watermark advance) replaces the v_step height-window loop.
//
// Bumped 10→11: fold-forward consumer. v10's fatal flaw was that every CALL
// re-aggregated each candidate parent's ENTIRE spend history (the spend_agg CTE
// joined spends_pNN over the whole (watermark, safe_tip] range) — O(lifetime
// spends), which grows unbounded with the chain and cannot keep up with IBD,
// freezing the watermark. v11 folds only NEW spends, once, forward-only: per
// bounded height band it aggregates ONLY that band's spends, increments each
// parent's spent_progress counter, and stamps delete_at_height when the counter
// reaches spendable_count. Cost per band is O(new spends in band), independent of
// chain size, so the watermark always advances.
//
// Bumped 11→12: merge the per-band FOLD and STAMP into a SINGLE UPDATE ...
// RETURNING. v11 wrote the hot txs table TWICE per band — once to fold
// (spent_progress += n, last_spend_height) and again to stamp delete_at_height —
// and scanned the band twice. For txs that complete on the folded spend this
// doubled txs dead-tuple churn on the hottest table (~15% measured throughput
// regression). v12 stamps INLINE from the NEW spent_progress in the same UPDATE,
// so each folded tx is written once and the band is scanned once. Semantics are
// identical: same rows stamped, same delete_at_height values, same pending_deletes
// upserts.
//
// Bumped 12→13: authorise the stamp from GROUND TRUTH, not the counter. The
// maintained spent_progress can drift UPWARD — a reorg rewinds the watermark and the
// forward-only fold re-counts still-present spends (also plain arithmetic/lost-update
// drift). Trusting the counter stamped, and the pruner then irreversibly cascade-
// deleted, a tx whose output was still an unspent UTXO (the IBD data-loss wedge,
// mainnet h63266 / testnet …5e5ea, 2026-07-02). v13 keeps the counter as a cheap gate
// (spent_progress + d.n >= spendable_count) but confirms full-spend with a bounded
// recount of the tx's spendable spends (up to the band ceiling) before stamping, so a
// drifted counter can no longer schedule a live UTXO for deletion. The pending_deletes
// feed now keys off delete_at_height IS NOT NULL alone (the old spent_progress =
// spendable_count filter would wrongly drop a row the recount stamped after an
// overshoot). The counter itself is healed by the reconcile backstop.
//
// Bumped 13→14: delete the in-proc lock_timeout; work is bounded by units, never
// clocks. Three production incidents (2026-07-01, 07-02, 07-04→06) traced to the
// same execution-model flaw: wall-clock limits on healthy work. At dense chain
// regions one band's fold legitimately runs for many minutes; the Go client's
// 120s CALL timeout cancelled every CALL inside its first band → rollback →
// retry the SAME band forever → 36h zero-progress treadmill at INFO level →
// 343GB of unpruned rows → disk full → postgres crash. Raising the timeout then
// exposed the next clock: lock_timeout='5s' aborts an entire band (minutes of
// disk-bound work) because ONE row was contended for five seconds — and the
// contended rows were the reconciler's, whose whole job is touching the same
// drifted parents the fold re-touches (deadlock class 40P01). v14's position:
//   - A band takes as long as it takes. Interruption safety comes from the
//     per-band atomic COMMIT (fold+stamp+watermark), not from deadlines — any
//     interruption costs at most one band.
//   - Row-lock waits are waited out: hot-path writers hold row locks for
//     milliseconds; anything longer is a wedge, and a wedge is an ALERTING
//     problem (the Go-side stagnation monitor), not a transaction-abort problem.
//   - The DAH writers themselves never contend: the reconciler takes this
//     procedure's per-partition advisory lock (gate CTE), so fold and audit are
//     mutually exclusive per partition by construction.
//
// The Go driver mirrors this: no per-CALL context timeout (deleted), per-
// partition loops with idle-interval backoff on errors, and clock-immunity GUCs
// (statement_timeout=0 etc.) pinned on the maintenance pool — a server-level
// statement_timeout armed at CALL start cannot be defused by SET LOCAL inside
// the procedure. The only remaining "timeout" is the stagnation monitor
// (dah_stagnation.go): watermark frozen + backlog > 0 → Warnf → Errorf + gauge.
// It cancels nothing; a human decides. See TUNING.md "Execution model (v14)".
//
// Bumped 14→15: idempotent spent-bitmap fold; the stamp-time ground-truth
// recount is DELETED. v13's recount was the O(lifetime-spends) cost class
// reintroduced at stamp time: ~K random COLD heap reads per completing parent
// (spends are append-ordered by time while prev_tx_hash is random — a parent
// spent over years has K rows on ~K distinct pages), re-fired on EVERY later
// band for counter-overshoot parents. On mainnet it could not keep pace with
// IBD (2026-07-07 disk-full incident: watermarks froze hours BEFORE the disk
// filled). The recount existed only because the arithmetic spent_progress
// counter drifts; v15 replaces the counter with a per-output spent bitmap
// (txs.spent_bits) whose fold is idempotent by construction — OR-ing the same
// spend's bit twice is a no-op, so every counter-drift class (reorg
// watermark-rewind re-fold, reconciler double-cover, Unspend of never-folded
// spends) is structurally harmless — and the stamp gate becomes a single-row
// check: bit_count(spent_bits) = spendable_count. No spends-history read
// exists anywhere in the stamp path. The one residual hazard (a fold statement
// whose band snapshot predates a concurrent Unspend commit can re-set a
// just-cleared bit) is healed within ~one reconcile tick via the
// dah_dirty_parents queue Unspend populates transactionally.
//
// v15 also re-quantises bands by WORK, not heights: the fold source is capped
// at band_rows spends (ORDER BY spent_at_height LIMIT band_rows) and the
// watermark advances to the last FULLY-covered height (max_h - 1), re-folding
// the boundary height next band — legal only because duplicate ORs are free.
// A single height holding >= band_rows spends alone is full-drained as one
// band (bounded overshoot of one block). This kills the dense-region
// multi-hour, temp-spilling folds (band_heights=5000 could mean millions of
// rows); work_mem for the fold is pinned per band from the work_mem_mb knob.
// The watermark advance is a CAS (WHERE last_swept_height = v_from): a
// concurrent reorg rewind mid-CALL rolls the band back and ends the CALL so
// the rewound range is always re-folded.
//
// Bumped 15→16: single-byte fast path in the fold. Profiling the pruned bench
// showed the CALL at 12.3% of DB time while ~100% of its parents' band spends
// land in ONE mask byte (any <=8-output tx, any single-spend fold). Those
// parents now take an in-place set_byte OR (upd_fast) and skip the gap-filled
// string_agg/LATERAL mask machinery entirely; multi-byte parents keep the
// general path (upd_slow). Semantics identical — OR is idempotent and
// position-exact — and a width-guard routes any short spent_bits row to
// "unchanged, no stamp" (reconciler heals) instead of a band-aborting error.
//
// Bumped 16→17: below-checkpoint early DAH. A new p_checkpoint BIGINT parameter
// (0 = off) lets the stamp skip the retention wait for a tx whose mined height AND
// every folded spend height are at-or-below a hardcoded consensus checkpoint,
// where a reorg is impossible by rule. Both stamp sites (upd_fast/upd_slow) gate
// the retention term on the SAME GREATEST(last_spend, folded max_h, mined) the
// stamp uses: delete_at_height = GREATEST(..) + 1 + CASE WHEN GREATEST(..) <=
// p_checkpoint THEN 0 ELSE retention END. Keying the CASE on the same GREATEST is
// the load-bearing safety invariant — a row qualifies for the immediate stamp only
// when nothing about it (mine or any spend) sits above the boundary. The idempotent
// bitmap fold is untouched. The sanctioned zero-spendable inline stamp in mined.go
// is deliberately NOT changed: it keeps full retention (it never runs the sweep's
// per-band boundary logic and its all-OP_RETURN txs are cheap to retain).

// dahSweepProcDDLWithPendingDeletes is the spent-bitmap fold DAH sweep procedure
// (installed at proc version dahSweepProcVersion).
//
// v11 replaced v10's full-range re-aggregation with a forward-only fold. v12
// merged fold + stamp into one UPDATE ... RETURNING. v13 added a stamp-time
// ground-truth recount (drift-prone counter). v14 dropped in-proc lock_timeout.
// v15 replaces the counter with the idempotent spent_bits bitmap and DELETES the
// recount — no spends-history read exists anywhere in this procedure. Per band:
//
//  1. BAND SOURCE (work-quantised): the band is the next band_rows spends above
//     the watermark (ORDER BY spent_at_height LIMIT band_rows), capped at
//     band_heights heights for sparse regions. O(new spends in band) with a
//     row-bounded constant, regardless of chain density.
//  2. FOLD + STAMP in ONE UPDATE: aggregate the band's SPENDABLE spends into a
//     per-parent byte mask (byte i/8 gets bit 1<<(i%8) — the same LSB-first
//     encoding as out_spendables/get_bit), OR it into txs.spent_bits with a
//     multi-column SET row-subquery (the OR is evaluated once), advance
//     last_spend_height, and stamp delete_at_height inline when
//     bit_count(new_bits) = spendable_count AND mined_at_height IS NOT NULL AND
//     delete_at_height IS NULL AND preserve_until IS NULL AND unmined_since IS
//     NULL. delete_at_height = GREATEST(new last_spend_height, mined_at_height)
//     + 1 + retention. Every freshly stamped row is upserted into
//     pending_deletes_pNN in the same statement. A parent stamped in a PRIOR
//     band keeps its stamp (delete_at_height IS NULL guard); its pending_deletes
//     re-upsert rewrites the unchanged value — harmless. Duplicate folds are
//     no-ops by construction (OR), so re-processing after a watermark rewind or
//     a boundary-height re-fold cannot drift anything.
//  3. ADVANCE the watermark with a CAS (WHERE last_swept_height = v_from): if
//     the band was row-truncated the advance target is max_h - 1 (the boundary
//     height re-folds next band); a single height holding >= band_rows spends
//     alone is re-run as one full height (bounded overshoot of one block). A
//     CAS miss means a reorg rewound the watermark mid-CALL: the band ROLLS
//     BACK and the CALL exits so the next CALL restarts from the rewound
//     height. Fold + stamp + advance are ONE transaction per band.
//
// The loop runs at most v_max_bands (dah_sweep_control.max_windows_per_call)
// bands per CALL; work_mem is pinned per band from work_mem_mb so the fold
// aggregation does not spill to pgsql_tmp at sane band sizes.
//
// Division of labour: a tx spent-before-mined has its bits folded here but is
// NOT stamped (mined gate) — the mine path (SetMinedMulti) stamps it at mine
// from the same single-row bitmap gate. The sweep only stamps the
// mined-then-spent completion. The dirty-parents queue (dah_dirty_parents,
// populated transactionally by Unspend) plus the rotating rotating-slice audit
// (dah_reconcile.go) heal the one residual stale-snapshot hazard and any
// unforeseen bit corruption; the reconciler recomputes spent_bits from spends
// over bounded slices and un-stamps wrong stamps.
