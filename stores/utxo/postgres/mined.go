		// stale-snapshot race (a concurrent fold re-setting a bit Unspend just
		// cleared) is healed by the reconciler via dah_dirty_parents, not here.

		//     once mined; handled explicitly so it never relies on a vacuous bitmap
		//     equality — out_spendables is NULLable, so the 0-spendable case must not
		//     depend on bitmap state at all)
		//   OR fully-spent: spendable_count > 0 AND bit_count(spent_bits) = spendable_count
		//     (every spendable output's bit has been folded — spent_bits ⊆
		//     out_spendables, so equality means fully spent). Reads two row-local
		//     columns; no join.
		//
		// Completion-height formula: GREATEST(last_spend_height, $5/*minedHeight*/)
		// + 1 + $6/*retention*/ — matches the sweep proc's stamp (which also uses
		// last_spend_height) so both stamp sites agree, and a late mine cannot schedule
		// deletion too early. COALESCE(last_spend_height, 0) guards the zero-spendable
		// case where the counter never folded a spend (last_spend_height IS NULL) →
		// completion falls back to the mined height. Cast to int for the INT4 column.
		//
		// mined_at_height is the height of the block this tx is mined into
		// (minedBlockInfo.BlockHeight), bound as $5 — NOT the store's current
		// chain tip. Binding it as a parameter (a) keeps mined_at_height
		// consistent with the height packed into the mined_info record ($3) even
		// under concurrent SetBlockHeight, and (b) preserves a single prepared-plan
		// cache entry across heights (a literal would re-plan per height).
		//
		// The UPDATE is wrapped in a CTE so that any fully-spent tx that gets an inline
