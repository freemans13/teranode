// The clock alone is not enough. Once a clock cohort has been mapped to a block,
// a transaction stamped into that same cohort would read as mined even though it
// was never in the block. So the stamper keeps a floor: the newest clock cohort
// it has been told is already mapped. Stamps are never issued at or below that
// floor.
// Stamp is lock-free: it reads the floor, compares, and returns. Two callers
// racing on the fallback both return floor+1, which is correct - a cohort is a
// group, many transactions share one - and neither can land at or below the
// floor, which is the only thing the guard has to guarantee. Stamping is on the
// per-transaction create path, so it must not serialise on a mutex.
