| OrphanEvictionDuration | time.Duration | 10m | legacy_orphanEvictionDuration | Orphan transaction retention |
| StoreBatcherSize | int | 1024 | legacy_storeBatcherSize | **CRITICAL** - Store operation batch size |

| OutpointBatcherConcurrency | int | 32 | legacy_outpointBatcherConcurrency | Outpoint operation parallelism |
| PrintInvMessages | bool | false | legacy_printInvMessages | Debug logging for inventory messages |
| GRPCAddress | string | "" | legacy_grpcAddress | **CRITICAL** - gRPC client connections (required for client, returns error if empty) |
| AllowBlockPriority | bool | false | legacy_allowBlockPriority | Block priority handling |
| GRPCListenAddress | string | "" | legacy_grpcListenAddress | gRPC server binding |
| SavePeers | bool | false | legacy_savePeers | Peer information persistence |
| AllowSyncCandidateFromLocalPeers | bool | false | legacy_allowSyncCandidateFromLocalPeers | **CRITICAL** - Local peer sync candidate selection |
| TempStore | *url.URL | "file://./data/tempstore" | temp_store | **CRITICAL** - Temporary storage location |
| PeerIdleTimeout | time.Duration | 125s | legacy_peerIdleTimeout | **CRITICAL** - Peer inactivity timeout |
| PeerProcessingTimeout | time.Duration | 3m | legacy_peerProcessingTimeout | **CRITICAL** - Message processing timeout |
| BlockFailureBackoffBase | time.Duration | 5s | legacy_blockFailureBackoffBase | Base per-block backoff after a transient storage/service failure (0 disables) |
| BlockFailureBackoffMaxDuration | time.Duration | 150s | legacy_blockFailureBackoffMaxDuration | Cap on the per-block backoff window and the failure-tracking map TTL, kept below the 180s sync-peer stall window (0 disables) |
| BlockPrefetchBufferBytes | int64 | 268435456 | legacy_blockPrefetchBufferBytes | Byte budget for blocks downloaded ahead of processing during sync (0 disables prefetch) |
| BlockDownloadTimeoutBasePercent | int64 | 100 | legacy_blockDownloadTimeoutBasePercent | Ceiling on one block download at the chain tip, as a percentage of the target block interval; floored at 30 minutes, so values at or below 300 have no effect on a 10-minute chain |
| BlockDownloadTimeoutBaseIBDPercent | int64 | 600 | legacy_blockDownloadTimeoutBaseIBDPercent | The same ceiling while catching up, when blocks are larger and validation backpressure delays the read loop; also floored at 30 minutes, which the 600 default clears on a 10-minute chain |
| BlockDownloadTimeoutPerPeerPercent | int64 | 50 | legacy_blockDownloadTimeoutPerPeerPercent | Extra ceiling allowed per other peer we are downloading from, since our downstream link is shared; the total is floored at 30 minutes, so this can only add patience |
| MaxBlockParallelFetch | int | 2 | legacy_maxBlockParallelFetch | Maximum peers downloading the same stalled frontier block at once (1 disables racing) |
| BlockSlowFetchTimeout | time.Duration | 20s | legacy_blockSlowFetchTimeout | How long the download frontier may sit unchanged before a second peer is asked for the same block (0 disables racing) |
| MultiPeerBlockDownload | bool | true | legacy_multiPeerBlockDownload | Download block bodies from every eligible peer during legacy sync (false restores the single-sync-peer path) |
| MaxBlocksInTransitPerPeer | int | 16 | legacy_maxBlocksInTransitPerPeer | Maximum block bodies one peer may be downloading at once (the block-size ladder lowers it further for large blocks) |
| BlockDownloadWindow | int | 1024 | legacy_blockDownloadWindow | Maximum block bodies the whole node may be downloading at once, counting every peer together (a count, not svnode's per-peer height range) |
| BlockDownloadLowerWindow | int | 0 | legacy_blockDownloadLowerWindow | Never ask for a block more than this many ahead of the one waiting to be committed (0 disables; svnode uses 10 when pruning) |
| ParkOutOfOrderBlocks | bool | true | legacy_parkOutOfOrderBlocks | Write a block whose parent is not stored yet to the temp store and commit it when the parent arrives, instead of discarding it |
| ParkMaxBytes | int64 | 4294967296 | legacy_parkMaxBytes | Ceiling on the total serialized bytes of out-of-order blocks held on disk (0 disables the park) |
| ParkStoreTimeout | time.Duration | 10s | legacy_parkStoreTimeout | Deadline carried by each park blob store operation, bounding the wait for the file store's shared permits on the in-order block commit goroutine |
| Upnp | bool | false | legacy_upnp | Enable UPnP for automatic port mapping |

## Configuration Dependencies

### Peer Connection Management

- `ListenAddresses` controls incoming connections (falls back to external IP:8333 if empty)
- `ConnectPeers` forces outgoing connections to specific peers
- When `ConnectPeers` is set, `MaxPeers` automatically set to match count (exclusive mode)
- `ConnectPeers` disables DNS seeding
- `SavePeers` controls peer information persistence to disk

### Batch Processing Performance

- Batch sizes and concurrency settings work together for memory and performance control
- `StoreBatcherSize` * `StoreBatcherConcurrency` limits concurrent requests

### Peer Timeout Management

- `PeerIdleTimeout` set to 125s to accommodate 2-minute ping/pong intervals
- `PeerProcessingTimeout` set to 3m for block processing (largest operations)

### Sync Candidate Selection

- When `AllowSyncCandidateFromLocalPeers = false`, only non-localhost peers can be sync candidates
- Prevents local peers from being selected as blockchain sync source

### Block Priority

- `AllowBlockPriority = true`: Enables block priority messages via connection streaming
- Sent via Protoconf message during peer handshake

### Block Prefetch

- `BlockPrefetchBufferBytes` bounds the bytes of received-but-not-yet-processed blocks so download overlaps validation during sync; `0` disables prefetch (synchronous ingestion).
- Big-block era: a block at least as large as the whole budget is admitted alone (weight clamped), giving zero overlap — identical to pre-prefetch behaviour. To get overlap on large blocks, set the budget to at least ~2× the typical block size.

## Service Dependencies

| Dependency | Interface | Usage |
|------------|-----------|-------|
| SubtreeStore | blob.Store | **CRITICAL** - Merkle subtree storage and verification |
| TempStore | blob.Store | **CRITICAL** - Temporary data storage during processing |
| UTXOStore | utxo.Store | **CRITICAL** - UTXO operations |
| BlockchainClient | blockchain.ClientI | **CRITICAL** - Blockchain operations and state queries |
| ValidatorClient | validator.Interface | **CRITICAL** - Transaction validation |
| SubtreeValidationClient | subtreevalidation.ClientI | **CRITICAL** - Subtree validation |
| BlockValidationClient | blockvalidation.ClientI | **CRITICAL** - Block validation |
| BlockAssemblyClient | blockassembly.ClientI | **CRITICAL** - Block assembly operations |

## Validation Rules

| Setting | Validation | Impact | When Checked |
|---------|------------|--------|-------------|
| GRPCAddress | Must not be empty | Client creation fails | During client initialization |
| ListenAddresses | Falls back to external IP:8333 if empty | Network connectivity | During server start |
| PeerIdleTimeout | Must accommodate ping/pong intervals | Peer stability | During peer connection |
| PeerProcessingTimeout | Must allow for block processing time | Message handling | During message processing |

## Configuration Examples

### Basic Configuration

```text
legacy_listen_addresses = "0.0.0.0:8333"
legacy_savePeers = false
```

### Forced Peer Connections

```text
legacy_connect_peers = "peer1.example.com:8333|peer2.example.com:8333"
legacy_allowSyncCandidateFromLocalPeers = false
```

### Performance Tuning

```text
legacy_storeBatcherSize = 2048
legacy_storeBatcherConcurrency = 64
legacy_spendBatcherSize = 2048
legacy_spendBatcherConcurrency = 64
```
