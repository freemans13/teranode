// for the ownership leak: the streamed route never called RemoveOwner or
// ForgiveOwners, the same pair handleBlockMsg calls the moment it dequeues a
// decoded block (manager.go, around handleBlockMsg's "This peer has answered"
// comment).
//
// Before this branch made the pipeline send every block down the on-disk route,
// that gap only bit blocks above the 64 MiB decode threshold, rare enough that
// nobody noticed a peer's assignment count creeping up. With PipelineReceive on,
// every block takes this route, so a peer that delivers sixteen blocks (the
// default MaxBlocksInTransitPerPeer) has its CountForPeer stick there forever —
// the scheduler's per-peer budget (block_scheduler.go:144) reaches zero and stops
// asking that peer for anything else until the hour-long assignment TTL expires.
//
// This drives three blocks through handleBlockOnDiskMsg for one peer and
// requires CountForPeer to return to zero, exactly as it does for the decoded
// route today.
