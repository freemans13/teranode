// message handler because a commit is minutes of work, and the outer handler
// dispatches disconnects, invs and headers for every peer.

// the rewound cursor out with it, and a node would sit on a perfectly good

// sending anything, and to call that check the whole of its safety. The rule it

// front — now lives in fetchMoreHeaderBlocks, which is the one place all three
// of the top-up callers pass through, and it is stated there as a fact about the
// list rather than about the cursor. What is left of the old check is an
// accident: "the cursor is on the front" is also false during an ordinary
// forward walk, where the cursor is deliberately ahead of the front, so the
// ticker declined to top the pipeline up in exactly the state the top-up exists
// for. Keeping it would have meant keeping a condition no test could hold to
