// TestSyncManager_CommittingAParkedBlockMidHeaderRoundDoesNotWedgeTheCheckpoint
// is the same rule as TestSyncManager_ATickBetweenHeaderBatchesDoesNotWedgeTheCheckpointTransition,
// asked of the other way into the same window.
//
// A checkpoint round runs in two halves. While the headers are still coming in,
// batch after batch, the front of the list is the previous round's anchor — a
// block already in this node's chain, kept only so the next header can prove it
// links, and one no peer will ever deliver again. The anchor comes off exactly
// once, taken by the batch that reaches the checkpoint, and only then may blocks
// be asked for. Anything that fetches in the first half wedges the second: the
// blocks arrive, none of them matches the front, none comes off the list, and
// when the anchor is finally trimmed the front becomes a block that has already
// been delivered — which nothing after it matches either. The checkpoint block
// is never recognised as the checkpoint, the next round of headers is never
// asked for, and sync sits until the 180-second stall detector rotates the peer.
//
// The park reaches that window through the sweep, and it is the sweep's designed
// case that takes it there. A node that restarts mid-sync with blocks in the
// park adopts them on the way up; their parents are already in the chain, so no
// commit event ever drains them and the sweep is the only thing that will ever
// look at them. Two minutes later a sweep tick commits one — and a successful
// commit's last act is to top the download pipeline back up. With mainnet
// checkpoint gaps running to 50,000 blocks, about 25 sequential header
// round-trips, a tick lands in the first half of a round routinely.
//
// Blocks are delivered only if they were actually asked for, which is what a
// peer does, so the test cannot heal a walk that asked for a block at the wrong
// moment.
