// This file lets a second peer be asked for the one block that is holding up
// headers-first sync.
//
// Blocks are committed strictly in order, so the oldest block we have asked for
// and not yet received — the download frontier — gates everything behind it. If
// the peer carrying it silently drops the getdata, sync simply stops. The only
// other response is the 180-second sync-peer stall timer, which with the fan-out
// off disconnects the peer and throws away the entire downloaded header list
// (resetHeaderState), forcing a fresh getheaders round from someone else. One
// dropped request therefore costs three minutes of nothing plus a full header
// re-download.
//
// This file was written when every block body was requested from the sync peer,
// so "the peer that owes the frontier" and "the sync peer" were the same peer
// and the code said the latter. With the scheduler they are routinely different
// peers, and everything below asks about the owner of the frontier hash instead:
// the ledger knows who owes it.
//
// Instead, once the frontier has sat unchanged for legacy_blockSlowFetchTimeout,
// we send one additional getdata for that single hash to one more connected peer
// and leave the original request in place. Whichever copy lands first is
// processed normally and the other is discarded. Nothing is ever moved or
// cancelled, only added, so there is no way for the block to end up owned by
// nobody or handed back to the same silent peer forever.
//
// This deliberately does not touch the 180-second backstop. A racer's delivery
// does not refresh the sync peer's last-block time (HandleBlockDirect only
// refreshes it via syncPeerStateFor, which is false for any other peer), so a
// sync peer that never delivers anything is still rotated on the same schedule.
// Racing buys progress inside that window; it does not extend it.

const (
	// frontierCheckInterval is how often the block handler asks whether the
	// download frontier has been stuck long enough to be worth asking a second
	// peer for. Well under legacy_blockSlowFetchTimeout so the timeout, not the
	// timer granularity, decides when a race starts.

	// racedBlockGraceTTL is how long we remember that a particular peer was
	// asked for a particular block as part of a race, so that a late copy from
	// it is dropped quietly rather than treated as an unrequested block.
	//
	// It is the ledger's own ownership ceiling, not the peer package's 30-minute
	// constant it used to be. That constant stopped being the ceiling on a block
	// download when blockDownloadBudget started scaling one: at the IBD defaults
	// a peer sharing our downlink with seven others is given 95 minutes, so a
	// grace of 30 left an hour in which a peer still legitimately sending was
	// disconnected for answering us. Matching the ledger means the grace lasts
	// exactly as long as the node considers anybody to owe the block at all.
	//
	// This is now belt-and-braces rather than the mechanism. noteRaceWinner
	// forgives the other owners instead of cancelling them, so their permission
	// to deliver comes from the ledger itself and expires with it — which is what
	// closed the residual an earlier version of this comment had to admit. What is
	// left for this map is the peer that actually delivered, whose obligation
	// handleBlockMsg removes: a second copy from that one peer is the only case
