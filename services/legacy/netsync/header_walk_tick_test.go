// TestSyncManager_ATickBetweenHeaderBatchesDoesNotWedgeTheCheckpointTransition
// is about where the download walk may be driven from.
//
// A checkpoint round runs in two halves. First the headers come in, batch after
// batch, and while that is happening the front of the header list is still the
// previous round's anchor — a block that is already in the chain and will never
// be delivered again, kept only so the next header can prove it links. The
// anchor is taken off exactly once, by the batch that reaches the checkpoint,
// and only then may blocks be asked for.
//
// Anything that fetches blocks in the first half wedges the second. The blocks
// arrive while the anchor is the front, so they never match it and never come
// off the list; then the anchor is trimmed and the front becomes a block that
// has already been delivered. Nothing after that ever matches the front again,
// so the checkpoint block is never recognised as the checkpoint, the next round
// of headers is never asked for, and sync stops until the 180-second stall
// detector rotates the peer and rebuilds the list. Mainnet checkpoint gaps run
// to 50,000 blocks — 25 sequential header round-trips — so a thirty-second tick
// lands in that window routinely.
//
// The end state asserted here is the one the round needs: after a tick has
// landed mid-headers, the checkpoint block still reports itself as the
// checkpoint when it arrives. Blocks are delivered only if they were actually
// asked for, which is what a peer does, so the test cannot heal a walk that
// asked for a block at the wrong moment.

// A checkpoint transition does not rebuild the header list. It leaves the
// checkpoint node in it as the next round's anchor and moves the checkpoint on
// to the next one, which on mainnet is tens of thousands of blocks higher. So
// for as long as it takes the next round of headers to arrive, the list holds
// one node — the anchor — sitting far below the checkpoint height.
//
// A block from the round that has just finished can be given up on in that
// window: it was parked when it arrived, its time ran out, and the sweep puts
// the walk back on it. Its header node carries the epoch of a list that is still
// the live list, so it goes back in — and because the list runs in ascending
// height it goes in AHEAD of the anchor. The front of the list is now a block
// this node wants and nobody has asked for since.
//
// Reading the answer off the list's tail cannot tell that state from the one
// above it: the tail is the anchor either way, and it is below the checkpoint
// height either way. So the top-up refuses to run, and the one thing that would
// have asked for the given-up block again does nothing. Nothing else asks — the
// getblocks the drop paths send is thrown away by processInvMsg while
// headers-first mode is on — so the block is lost until the stall detector
// rotates the peer.
