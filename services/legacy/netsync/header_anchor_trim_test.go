// TestSyncManager_ARewoundHeaderInFrontOfTheAnchorSurvivesTheCheckpointTrim is
// the first of the two ways the trim used to lose a real header.
//
// The checkpoint trim used to remove Front() on the strength of a comment: the
// first entry of the list is always the block already in the database. A rewind
// after a checkpoint transition makes that false. The transition does not rebuild
// the list — it leaves the old checkpoint node in it as the new anchor — so the
// epoch check that stops a stale header node going back into a rebuilt list does
// not fire, and reinsertHeaderLocked inserts by height, which puts a header from
// the round just finished IN FRONT of the anchor.
//
// Removing the front there deletes the block that was just put back to be asked
// for again, from the list and from the index, and leaves the anchor in place to
// wedge the front all over again. Nothing after it ever matches the front, so
// the checkpoint block is never recognised as the checkpoint, the next round of
// headers is never asked for, and sync sits until the 180-second stall detector
// rotates the peer.
//
// The end state asserted is the one the round needs: every block in the list is
// asked for — the rewound one included — and the checkpoint block still reports
// itself as the checkpoint when it arrives. Blocks are delivered only if they
// were actually asked for, which is what a peer does, so the test cannot heal a
// walk that asked for the wrong thing.
