// The two drain paths that give a block up — an unusable blob and a block that
// will not commit — both rewind the download walk, and both were only ever
// driven by tests that delivered a block which was NOT the front of the header
// list. That is the easy branch: the header is still indexed, so the rewind
// finds it by lookup and never needs the header node the park carried with the
// block. Passing nil for that node at either site changed nothing any test could
// see.
//
// A block that arrives as the FRONT is the case the machinery exists for. Its
// header is removed from the list AND unindexed before the park ever sees the
// block, so unless the node travelled with it there is nothing to rewind onto,
// and the block leaves the download walk for good. Both tests here drive that.

// parkFrontBlock delivers the FRONT block of the header list, which parks
// because its parent is not stored, and returns its hash. Delivering the front
// is what makes the removedFront threading matter: the header is removed from
// the list AND unindexed before the park ever sees the block, so any path that
// later gives the block up has nothing to look it up by.
