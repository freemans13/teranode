// BlockBody describes a block whose transactions were streamed straight to the
// park's blob store rather than decoded into memory.
//
// It exists because nothing between the wire and the park reads a transaction.
// The park's stateless check needs the header, to see the block hashes to what
// we asked for and meets its own target difficulty, and needs the transaction
// count to be non-zero. The park's byte budget needs the size, which the wire
// message declares. The arrival path needs the previous block hash, which is in
// the header. On mainnet 91% of blocks arrive out of order and take exactly that
// path, so for those the four-gigabyte object was built only to be serialised
// straight back out.

	// Converted reports whether the sink that accepted this body actually
	// converted it — wrote a park record derived from its subtrees, as the
	// pipeline sink does — rather than merely writing the whole body

	// at the one place that genuinely knows: the sink call itself. Nothing
	// downstream should ever try to answer this question by inference (for
	// example, by checking whether some blob happens to exist for this hash),
	// because a blob that exists for another reason — a stale leftover, a
	// racing duplicate delivery of the same hash — looks identical to one this
	// delivery actually produced.
