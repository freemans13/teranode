// quickWindow lets up to depth consecutive below-checkpoint blocks have their UTXO store work
// in flight at once while every chain-order step still runs in height order.
//
// Three rules make the overlap safe, and each has one home here:
//
//  1. A create never waits and a spend waits for the create that made its coin. Spends of an
//     in-block parent already wait on the two-phase path in quick_validate.go; spends of a coin
//     created by an in-flight PREDECESSOR wait on that predecessor's batchGate, looked up in
//     the open-gate map by parent transaction id. A gate closes when its batch's create side has
//     returned, and every store caller blocks until its statement commits, so a closed gate
//     means a committed create.
//  2. Commits run in admission order, one committer goroutine, and admission accepts only the
//     tail's child, so the chain store never sees height h+1 before h.
//  3. Fail closed: when an entry fails, every later entry is marked aborted with a service
//     error recorded on the entry before anything is signalled, so the block validation call
//     for an aborted block returns that error and legacy sync sees a local fault, never a peer
//     fault. Nothing is committed for the failed block or anything behind it; the store's own
//     create and spend guards make the re-delivery converge on the serial result.
//
// Nothing here is sized by the chain: the open-gate and retained maps hold the transaction ids
// of in-flight blocks only, and legacy sync's byte budget bounds how many blocks that is.
