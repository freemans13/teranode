// checkCanonicalTxEncoding rejects a transaction whose wire bytes are not the
// shortest encoding of themselves (issue 1421).
//
// Bitcoin and SV Node require every CompactSize length prefix to be written in
// its minimal form — writing the value 1 as `fd 01 00` instead of `01` is a
// hard parse error there. go-bt's varint reader has no such check: it accepts
// the over-long form and then RE-SERIALIZES it canonically, so the txid
// Teranode computes is the canonical one. That combination is what makes this
// a consensus hazard rather than a curiosity: an attacker ships non-minimal
// bytes while committing the canonical txids in the merkle tree, so
// Teranode's merkle check passes and the block is accepted, while every SV
// Node fleet member rejects the same block at parse time. Neither side logs
// an error; the fleets simply disagree about which chain is real, and because
// the block is already on disk a restart does not clear it.
//
// The check is a length comparison, not a re-parse: any non-minimal prefix
// makes the consumed wire bytes longer than the canonical serialization, so
// comparing the bytes consumed against the canonical size detects every such
// encoding at negligible cost. Do not "fix up" the transaction by accepting
// the canonical form — that would let a malformed transaction change identity
// mid-flight; reject it.
//
// The failure is a ProcessingError, deliberately NOT a TxInvalidError, and
// must stay that way. Non-minimality is a property of the DELIVERY, not of the
// block: because go-bt canonicalizes, the txids and therefore the merkle root
// are identical either way, so the same subtree fetched from an honest peer
// validates fine, and marking the block invalid would be simply wrong.
//
// Concretely, from the readTxFromReader caller the error travels
// getMissingTransactionsBatch -> getSubtreeMissingTxs -> ValidateSubtreeInternal
// -> validateMissingSubtreesWithOrderedRetry, which wraps it with
// errors.WrapGRPC, so the code survives the gRPC hop to blockvalidation. There
// BlockValidation.ValidateBlock tests errors.Is(err, ErrTxInvalid) on the
// validateBlockSubtrees result: a TxInvalidError would reach storeInvalidBlock
// and mark a perfectly valid block permanently invalid, surviving restart,
// while the resulting BlockInvalidError makes isUnvalidatablePeerError true and
// stops us trying another source — handing any peer we fetch from a cheap way
// to poison a valid block. Wrapping does not contain the code either:
// errors.Is walks the chain by code (errors/errors.go (*Error).Is), so a
// TxInvalidError inside a ProcessingError still matches ErrTxInvalid.
//
// From the readTransactionsFromSubtreeDataStream caller that branch is not
// reachable TODAY only by accident: CheckBlockSubtrees returns the batch
// pipeline's error without errors.WrapGRPC, so grpc-go flattens it to
// codes.Unknown with no TError detail and UnwrapGRPC rebuilds a bare
// ERR_ERROR. Adding the missing WrapGRPC there is a plausible future fix, and
// would immediately restore the hazard — so do not rely on the code being
// dropped in transit.
//
// What ProcessingError buys instead is bounded retry rather than poisoning: on
// the catchup route the block is retried against alternative peers and then
// counted against CatchupMaxAttemptsPerBlock (default 5) with a 10-minute
// cooldown, and ReportPeerFailure rotates the sync peer. If every peer serves
// the same non-minimal bytes the node stops advancing at that height instead of
// recording a false verdict, and recovers by itself as soon as one peer serves
// canonical bytes. That is the same liveness profile as the established sibling
// check in this package — the "subtree data does not match subtree"
// ProcessingError in getSubtreeMissingTxs — and it is the right trade for a
// consensus-divergence hazard: stalling is recoverable, a wrong verdict is not.
//
// Subtree data may carry EXTENDED transactions (each input also carrying its
// parent's satoshis and locking script), which serialize longer than tx.Size()
// reports — a subtree-data file written from parsed transactions keeps whatever
// form they were in, while the asset service's on-demand generator writes the
// standard form. The comparison is therefore made against whichever
// serialization the transaction actually uses (util.CanonicalTxSize), or a
// legitimate extended transaction would be rejected as non-canonical. That size
// is computed arithmetically: calling ExtendedBytes here would allocate and copy
// every transaction twice, on the very loop that was built to read transactions
// without allocating.
